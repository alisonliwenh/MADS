    "For the \"The long-term future of hits from 2013\", it works ineffectively when selecting more than five tracks. There're too many lines in the single chart and most of them are mixed together which is hard to read. The visuliazation losts the information of playcounts data and the reader is unable to read the accurate number of playcounts. Besides that, it is difficult to figure out the exact differences among several tracks since the visualization is lack of neccessary interactions such as showing details while mouse overing the line. For this project, the mult-line chart might not be a good choice. I will use the bar chart with filtering and interactive labeling instead of the multi-line chart."

The good news is there's an example that's really close to [what you need](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/multiline_tooltip.html). But you'll need to understand what's going on and modify it.\n",

    "Some hints: \n",
    "* You probably want to copy your code for ```generateLineChartP21``` into the new function. There are pieces of code  you defined (e.g., the selection) that you'll need to use again.\n",
    "* The example relies a lot on overloading Altair charts from a common base (e.g., ```line = alt.Chart(...``` and then ```newline = line.encode...``` so newline overloads/extends line). Our experience is that it's easy to get errors when doing this here because you'll be using multiple selections and conditions (another hint). We recommend defining the Altair charts (selectors, points, etc.) from scratch. It's more repeated code, but it'll save you the same headaches."
