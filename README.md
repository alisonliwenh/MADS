## MADS Course review:
### SIADS 501 Being a Data Scientist
* Medium workload
* Reading and writing intensive
* No coding
* Must-have course for the beginner of Data Science which provides a great deal of knowledge and common sense about Data Science in academic and professional espects. There're a plenty of readings, including articles, news, videos and podcasts, requiring you read and watch and reflect on them carefully and profoundly. It requires the student a high level of time management, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It builds up the mindset structure of being a Data Scientist which is not just coding and coding. I have learned so much from readings and interviews and really love this course. You can’t build a house without blueprints. Same as the data science project. It is important to have a clear understanding of the project we’re working on before we start hitting the keyboard. When I started to study Python by myself last year, I mostly liked hard-coding when I was having trouble with cleaning data. Now, when I am facing the same problems collecting and cleaning data again, I try to look for a way of coding to fix the problem instead of manipulating data manually which is meaningless and a waste of time.


### SIADS 505 Data Manipulation
* Medium/heavey worklaod
* Coding intensive (Python; pandas)
* Very general Python data cleaning course. You will use *Python for Data Analysis* as the textbook and learn some advanced pandas functions during coding assignments. Even though this is not a reading intensive course, I would like to recommend you read through the book from the beginning to the end if you want to enhance the ability of manipulating data. The lectures only taught some basic knowledge and simple examples as references. Keep in mind that these examples are just the opener. The student should be good at drawing inferences about other cases from one instance. Use slack group and Stack Overflow heavily and smartly. I have learned how to ask a "clear and good" question on Stack Overflow and it really helps you to improve the critical thinking and self-study skills.

### SIADS 502 Math Method for Data Science
* Light/medium workload
* Light reading and writing
* Light coding load (Python; numPy)
* Linear Algebra and Statistics
* Disordered course structure with many mistakes and errors in lectures and materials. The instructor doesn't really know what students' academic mathematical levels are. Since this is a non-math background data science program which means students have diverse math experiences/abilities. It is impossible to have the only one-month math course to satisfy all aspects of academic needs for this program. The lectures for profound math background students are too shallow, but for limited math background students are too difficult. Four assignments are not related to Python coding and two writing assignments are confused without effective grade criterias or samples. The female instructor just reads PPTs word by word which is unbearable at all.

### SIADS 522 Information Visualization I
* Heavy workload
* Coding intensive (Python; Altair; pandas)
* This is the Python course about visualization and it is time consuming because I never used Altair to create visualization before. It takes time to get familiar with Altair and handle it very skillfully. The professor provides a plenty of supplemental resources about creative visualization and videos about how to generate Altair transforms. Same as 505, it is required the student to go through the Altair documentation while doing assignments. Be aware of managing your schedule if you have full-time/part-time job because it is a time-consuming course and you might spend few hours to figure out 1 or 2 questions if you have no experience of Altair.

### SIADS 521 Visual Exploration of Data
* Light workload
* Light reading and No writing
* Medium coding load (Python; Matplotlib; Folium; Pandas; Plotly)
