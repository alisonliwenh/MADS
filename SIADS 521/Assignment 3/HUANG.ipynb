More specifically, I want you to write a tutorial demonstration which shows a new visualization technique (e.g. pareto charts) and/or a new visualization toolkit (e.g. bokeh, altair, seaborn, plot.ly). Feel free to do both a new technique and a new toolkit.\n","\n","The purpose of using a data visualization is to tell a story, and the purpose of writing up a demonstration is to teach someone else about what you have learned so that they can use it, too.

A specialty occupation requires the application of specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or the equivalent of work experience. However, there're an increasing number of complaints about the US companies abuse H1B visas to reduct human resource costs because citizens believe that most of H1B holders have relative low salaries comparing with Americans with same position and academic degree and those H1B holders take over citizens' jobs. Especially, when former US president, Donald Trump, suspended H1B visas denying employment permits for hundred of thousands of skilled foreign workers like programmers. Such a move hahas heightened tension between foreign skilled H1B participants and some of US citizens who have negative opinions of H1B.\n","\n","\n","1.
