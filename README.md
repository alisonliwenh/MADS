## MADS Course review:
### SIADS 501: Being a Data Scientist
* Medium workload
* Reading intensive
* Writing intensive

### SIADS 505: Data Manipulation
* Medium/heavey worklaod
* Coding intensive

### SIADS 502 Math Method for Data Science
* Light/medium workload
* Light coding 
* Disordered course schedule and structure with many mistakes and errors in lectures and materials. The instructor doesn't really know what students' academic mathematical level. The lectures for profound math background students are too shallow, but for limited math background students are too difficult. Four assignments are not related to Python coding and two writing assignments are confused without effective grade criterias or samples. It is impossible to have the only math course to satisfy all aspects of academic needs. The female instructor just read PPTs word by word which is unbearable at all.

### SIADS 522 Information Visualization I
* Heavy workload
* Coding intensive
