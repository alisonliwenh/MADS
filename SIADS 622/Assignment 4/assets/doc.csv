Maintaining Data Privacy in Asscociation Rule Mining,"Abstract
Data mining services require accurate input data for their results to be meaningful, but privacy concerns may influence users to pro- vide spurious information. We investigate here, with respect to mining association rules, whether users can be encouraged to provide correct information by ensuring that the mining process cannot, with any reasonable degree of certainty, violate their privacy. We present a scheme, based on probabilistic distortion of user data, that can simultaneously provide a high degree of privacy to the user and retain a high level of accuracy in the mining results. The performance of the scheme is validated against representative real and synthetic datasets.

Introduction
The knowledge models produced through data mining techniques are only as good as the accuracy of their in- put data. One source of data inaccuracy is when users deliberately provide wrong information. This is especially common with regard to customers who are asked to provide personal information on Web forms to e- commerce service providers. The compulsion for doing so may be the (perhaps well-founded) worry that the requested information may be misused by the service provider to harass the customer. As a case in point, consider a pharmaceutical company that asks clients to disclose the diseases they have suffered from in or- der to investigate the correlations in their occurrences. for example, ""Adult females with malarial infections are also prone to contract tuberculosis"". While the company may be acquiring the data solely for genuine data mining purposes that would eventually reflect it- self in better service to the client, at the same time the client might worry that if her medical records are either inadvertently or deliberately disclosed, it may adversely affect her employment opportunities.

We investigate, in this paper, whether customers can be encouraged to provide correct information by ensuring that the mining process cannot, with any rea- sonable degree of certainty, violate their privacy. At the same time, we would like the mining process to be as accurate as possible in terms of its results. The difficulty lies in the fact that these two metrics: privacy and accuracy, are typically contradictory in nature, with the consequence that improving one usually incurs a cost in the other. Therefore, we comprise on the ideal and perhaps infeasible goal of having both complete privacy and complete accuracy through approximate solutions that provide practically accept- able values for these metrics. Note further that since the purpose of data mining is essentially to identify statistical trends, cent-percent accuracy in the mining results is perhaps often not even a required feature.

Our study is carried out in the context of extracting association rules from large historical databases, a popular mining process that identifies interesting correlations between database attributes, such as the one described in the pharmaceutical example. For this framework, we present a scheme called MASK (Mining Associations with Secrecy Konstraints), that attempts to simultaneously provide a high degree of privacy to the user and retain a high degree of accuracy in the mining results. Our scheme is based on a simple probabilistic distortion of user data, employing random numbers generated from a pre-defined distribution function. It is this distorted information that is eventually supplied to the data miner, along with a description of the distortion procedure. We define a privacy metric and present an analytical formula for evaluating the privacy obtained under this metric by the distortion approach. 

A special feature of our scheme is that the distortion process can be easily implemented at the data source itself, that is, at the user machine. This increases the confidence of the user in providing accurate information since she does not have to trust a third-party to carry out the distortion process before the data is acquired by the service provider. Note that some of the other privacy techniques suggested in the literature, such as swapping values between records, do not support this feature since they require the entire database to be available for their functioning. 

As described in detail later in the paper, mining the distorted database can be, apart from being error-prone, significantly more expensive in terms of both time and space as compared to mining the true database. We present a variety of optimizations to address these issues. 

Finally, the performance of MASK's mining scheme is validated against representative real and synthetic datasets, with respect to both privacy and accuracy. Our results indicate that there are regions of the distortion parameter space that are conducive to satisfactorily meeting the dual objectives."
Association Rules and Data Mining in Hospital Infection Control and Public Health Surveillance,"Abstract
The authors consider the problem of identifying new, unexpected, and interesting patterns in hospital infection control and public health surveillance data and present a new data analysis process and system based on association rules to address this problem.
The authors first illustrate the need for automated pattern discovery and data mining in hospital infection control and public health surveillance. Next, they define association rules, explain how those rules can be used in surveillance, and present a novel process and system— the Data Mining Surveillance System (DMSS)—that utilize association rules to identify new and interesting patterns in surveillance data. Experimental results were obtained using DMSS to analyze Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection control data collected over one year (1996) at University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital. Experiments using one-, three-, and six-month time partitions yielded 34, 57, and 28 statistically significant events, respectively. Although not all statistically significant events are clinically significant, a subset of events generated in each analysis indicated potentially significant shifts in the occurrence of infection or antimicrobial resistance patterns of P. aeruginosa. The new process and system are efficient and effective in identifying new, unexpected, and interesting patterns in surveillance data. The clinical relevance and utility of this process await the results of prospective studies currently in progress.

Introduction
Surveillance systems are essential in detecting new and re-emerging threats of infectious agents in public 1–3 health and hospital settings. The effectiveness of these systems is determined by their ability to rapidly analyze time-series data to detect unusual disease
1,3 clusters. In a chapter on computerized public health surveillance systems in Principles and Practice of Public Health Surveillance, describe an ideal public health surveillance system.
In doing so, they give a hypo- thetic example in which the user, and epidemiologist, uses the ideal system to compare data recently collected with similar data from the past. Specifying no other constraints, the user ‘‘asks the system to pro- duce a series of maps for all conditions with unusual patterns.’’ Identifying those patterns that are most interesting, the investigator then employs traditional database query techniques and statistical analysis to investigate them further.

In addition to the political and administrative barriers that the authors identify as obstacles to practically realizing such a system, they correctly identify the following challenge: ‘‘Several kinds of mental shifts, as well as corresponding technical developments, will be necessary before a computerized system can be used to examine automatically a ‘time slice’ of disease and injury records that originate in clinics and hospitals.’’2 It is this challenge that we address. The process described in the example just given is analogous to data mining. Data mining, also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases, is the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful,4 and ultimately understandable patterns in data. Therefore, when Dean et al. describe an ideal surveillance system as one that must ‘‘produce a series of maps for all conditions with unusual patterns,’’ they describe a system that does data mining.

A number of statistical strategies have been developed for automatically detecting temporal patterns in surveillance data. Recently. have employed cumulative sums to detect unusual temporal patterns in Salmonella surveillance data. They show that cumulative sums are effective in detecting serotype specific Salmonella disease outbreaks at the state level. Their analysis, however, is limited to disease incidence over two-variable state-serotype combinations. Farrington et al. use a log-linear regression
model to automatically detect temporal clusters of disease by organism type using the weekly infectious disease reports of England and Wales. They look for national disease outbreaks by organism and, there- fore, consider disease incidence over one variable in time.

Until now, all automatic surveillance strategies have assumed that the user has a predefined outcome or case (e.g., Salmonella infections in a specific location) whose incidence is to be monitored for outbreaks in time. This has limited surveillance analysis to low- dimensional one-, two-, or possibly three-variable out- comes. If significant changes in incidence occur in out- comes not identified before analysis begins, these changes go undetected. We address the problem of automatically identifying new, unexpected, and interesting patterns in surveil- lance data. To this end, we propose a novel data mining surveillance process that is not constrained to looking for outbreaks within user-defined outcomes. In our process, arbitrarily complex outcomes are rep- resented by association rules, and their incidences are captured in the confidences of those rules over time. While deviations in outcome incidence can be detected using a number of different techniques, including cumulative sums and regression, we currently employ a simple chi-square–based test for this purpose.

The Data Mining Surveillance System (DMSS) is a computer data analysis system that we are developing based on the process just mentioned. In this paper we describe DMSS and experimental results obtained by using DMSS to analyze one year of Pseudomonas aeruginosa data from University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Hospital. Hospital infection control data, which contain elements of time, place, and person, are analogous to public health surveillance data, which contain similar data elements. Our process and system, therefore, apply to both public health and hospital infection control surveillance."
