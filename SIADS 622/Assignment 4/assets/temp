{"text": "Ballarat  is a city located on the Yarrowee River in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. The city has a population of 101,588. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2016.\n\nIn terms of population Ballarat is the third largest inland city in Australia.Profile of the Electoral Division of Ballarat (Vic) \u2013 Australian Electoral Commission. Aec.gov.au (7 October 2010). Retrieved 18 August 2011. \nJust months after Victoria was granted separation from the state of New South Wales, the Victorian gold rush transformed Ballarat from a small sheep station to a major settlement. Gold was discovered on 18 August 1851, and news quickly spread of rich alluvial fields where gold could easily be extracted. Unlike many other gold boom towns, the Ballarat fields experienced sustained high gold yields for many decades, which can be evidenced to this day in the city's rich architecture.\n\nThe city is famous in Australia for the Eureka Rebellion, the only armed rebellion in Australian history. In response to this event the first male suffrage in Australia was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of democracy in Australia. The rebellion's symbol, the Eureka Flag, has become a national symbol and is held at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th\u00a0century, after which its importance relative to both Melbourne and Geelong rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the 1956 Summer Olympics. It is the commercial capital of the Central Highlands and its largest city, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of Ballarat East in 1921, ending a long-standing rivalry.", "title": "Ballarat"}

{"text": "Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, usually from an ore body, lode, vein, seam, reef or placer deposit. These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.\n\nOres recovered by mining include metals, coal, oil shale, gemstones, limestone, chalk, dimension stone, rock salt, potash, gravel, and clay. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through agricultural processes, or feasibly created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.\n\nMining of stones and metal has been a human activity since pre-historic times. Modern mining processes involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of the profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the desired materials, and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed. De Re Metallica, Georgius Agricola, 1550, Book I, Para. 1\n\nMining operations usually create a negative environmental impact, both during the mining activity and after the mine has closed. Hence, most of the world's nations have passed regulations to decrease the impact. Work safety has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have significantly improved safety in mines.\n\nLevels of metals recycling are generally low. Unless future end-of-life recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable for use in a variety of consumer products. Due to the low recycling rates, some landfills now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.", "title": "Mining"}

is the county seat and most populous town of San Miguel County in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Colorado.  The town is a former silver mining camp on the San Miguel River in the western San Juan Mountains. The first gold mining claim was made in the mountains above Telluride in 1875 and early settlement of what is now Telluride followed. The town itself was founded in 1878 as \"Columbia\", but due to confusion with a California town of the same name, was renamed Telluride in 1887, for the gold telluride minerals found in other parts of Colorado. These telluride minerals were never found near Telluride, but the area's mines for some years provided zinc, lead, copper, silver, and other gold ores.\n\nTelluride sits in a box canyon. Steep forested mountains and cliffs surround it, with Bridal Veil Falls situated at the canyon's head. Numerous weathered ruins of old mining operations dot the hillsides. A free gondola connects the town with its companion town, Mountain Village, Colorado, at the base of the ski area. Telluride and the surrounding area have featured prominently in popular culture, and it is the subject of several popular songs. It is especially known for its ski resort and slopes during the winter, as well as an extensive festival schedule during the summer.\n\nThe Telluride Historic District, which includes a significant portion of the town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is also one of Colorado's 20 National Historic Landmarks. The town population was 2,325 in the 2010 United States Census.", "title": "Telluride, Colorado"}

Until the start of the 21st century, De Beers effectively had total control over the diamond market as a monopoly. Competition has since dismantled the complete monopoly, though the De Beers Group still sells approximately 35% of the world's rough diamond production through its global sightholder and auction sales businesses.The Incredible Story Of How De Beers Created And Lost The Most Powerful Monopoly Ever, Business Insider\n\nThe company was founded in 1888 by British businessman Cecil Rhodes, who was financed by the South African diamond magnate Alfred Beit and the London-based N M Rothschild & Sons bank.https://www.rothschildarchive.org/exhibitions/timeline/ In 1926, Ernest Oppenheimer, an immigrant to Britain and later South Africa who had earlier founded mining company Anglo American plc with American financier J.P. Morgan, was elected to the board of De Beers. He built and consolidated the company's global monopoly over the diamond industry until his death in 1957. During this time, he was involved in a number of controversies, including price fixing and trust behaviour, and was accused of not releasing industrial diamonds for the U.S. war effort during World War II.\n\nIn 2011, Anglo American took control of De Beers after buying the Oppenheimer's family stake of 40 percent for US$5.1 billion (\u00a33.2 billion) and increasing its stake to 85 percent, ending the 80-year Oppenheimer control of the company.

The Amungme people did not have the idea of \"gods\" that are separate from nature where spirits and nature are one and the same.\n\nThey practice shifting agriculture, supplementing their livelihood by hunting and gathering. The Amungme are very tied to their ancestral land and consider the surrounding mountains to be sacred.\n\nThis has led to friction with the Indonesian government, which is eager to exploit the vast mineral deposits contained there. Major changes in the Amungme of the highlands and Kamoro of the lowlands lifestyle have been brought about by the Grasberg mine, situated in the heart of Amungme territory and owned by Freeport-McMoRan, the region's largest single employer. Extensive gold and copper mining have altered the landscape, and the presence of the mine and its infrastructure has attracted numerous other economic migrants from western Indonesia as well as other Papuans, some of whom have tried to settle on traditional Amungme lands. This has caused land dispute regarding customary land rights between the Amungme people against Freeport Indonesia mining company in Timika. In the last 35 years, the Amungme have seen their sacred mountain destroyed by the mine, and watched as their relatives are killed by Indonesian soldiers \"defending\" it, while the Kamoro have more than 200,000 tons of waste pumped into their rivers each day.

It follows the story of country music singer Loretta Lynn from her birth in a poor family and getting married at 15 to her rise as one of the most successful country musicians. Based on Lynn's 1976 biography of the same name by George Vecsey, the film stars Sissy Spacek as Lynn. Tommy Lee Jones, Beverly D'Angelo and Levon Helm are featured in supporting roles. Ernest Tubb, Roy Acuff, and Minnie Pearl make cameo appearances as themselves.\n\nA film on Lynn's life was intended to be made since the release of the biography. Production for the film began on March 1979, and Lynn herself chose Spacek to portray her on screen after seeing a photograph of her despite being unfamiliar with her films. The film's soundtrack featured all Lynn's hit singles which were all sung by Spacek as well as Patsy Cline's \"Sweet Dreams\" sung by D'Angelo. The soundtrack reached the top 40 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200 and sold over 500,000 copies, thus being certified gold by the RIAA. \n\nCoal Miner's Daughter was released theatrically on March 7, 1980 and grossed $67.18 million in North America against a budget of $15 million, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 1980.

{"text": "Jerome is a town in the Black Hills of Yavapai County in the U.S. state of Arizona. Founded in the late 19th century on Cleopatra Hill overlooking the Verde Valley, it is more than  above sea level. It is about  north of Phoenix along State Route 89A between Sedona and Prescott. Supported in its heyday by rich copper mines, it was home to more than 10,000 people in the 1920s. As of the 2010 census, its population was 444.\n\nThe town owes its existence mainly to two ore bodies that formed about 1.75\u00a0billion years ago along a ring fault in the caldera of an undersea volcano. Tectonic plate movements, plate collisions, uplift, deposition, erosion, and other geologic processes eventually exposed the tip of one of the ore bodies and pushed the other close to the surface, both near Jerome. In the late 19th\u00a0century, the United Verde Mine, developed by William A. Clark, extracted ore bearing copper, gold, silver, and other metals from the larger of the two. The United Verde Extension UVX Mine, owned by James Douglas, Jr., depended on the other huge deposit. In total, the copper deposits discovered in the vicinity of Jerome were among the richest ever found.\n\nJerome made news in 1917, when strikes involving the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) led to the expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again during and after the Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100 by the mid-1950s. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21st\u00a0century, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history.", "title": "Jerome, Arizona"}

{"text": "The Town of Lake City is the Statutory Town that is the county seat and the only incorporated municipality in Hinsdale County, Colorado, United States.  It is located in the San Juan Mountains in a valley formed by the convergence of Henson Creek and the headwaters of the Lake Fork of the Gunnison River about seven miles (11\u00a0km) east of Uncompahgre Peak, a Colorado fourteener.\nLake City is named after nearby Lake San Cristobal.\nThis area lies at the southern end of the Colorado Mineral Belt and when rich mineral deposits were discovered the native population was pushed from their tribal lands and the town of Lake City was incorporated in 1873.\n\nWith the completion of the first road into the mountains in this region, Lake City served as a supply center for the many miners and prospectors flooding into the area.  As a supply center, the town  boomed to as many as 3,000 to 5,000 settlers.  But as the first-discovered deposits were found to be only moderately productive and no new extensive or rich deposits of minerals were found, by 1879 the boom had subsided.  With the arrival of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad in 1889,  Lake City saw a second upturn in the economy that lasted into the 1890s.  The railroad cut the cost of shipping gold and silver ores to smelters, reduced the cost of shipping supplies into Lake City, and  provided shipment of cattle and sheep into the area for summer grazing in the high Alpine meadows.\n\nBy 1905, the mining era was over and Lake City entered a decades-long period of economic decline.  Population figures hovered at 1,000 then dropped to 400 after 1910.  Although mining continued throughout the twentieth century, it consisted primarily of exploration and speculation rather than productive operation.  Beginning in 1915, visitors began coming to Lake City for the entire summer season and by the 1930s tourism had emerged as a viable industry.\n\nThe Hinsdale County Historical Society formed in 1973 and began accumulating documents and photographs recording the town's history.  In 1978, the Lake City Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Residents have restored many of the boom town mining era buildings  and  currently promote tourism as an industry. Restoration has not only aided the local economy by making Lake City a desirable tourist destination, it has served economic development with preservation projects creating jobs for local carpenters, craftsmen, and contractors.  The town population was 408 at the 2010 United States Census.  Lake City's educational needs are served by the Lake City Community School.", "title": "Lake City, Colorado"}

{"text": "The Four Georgians were a group of gold prospectors that are traditionally credited for discovering the Last Chance placer gold strike of Helena, Montana.  They were John Cowan, D. J. Miller, John Crab, and Reginald (Robert) Stanley.  Of the four, the only actual Georgian was Cowan, who hailed from Acworth, Georgia. The other three came from Alabama (Miller), Iowa (Crab) and England (Stanley). It has been speculated that they were named \"Georgians\" not from where they came from, but because they were practicing the \"Georgian method\" of placer mining.\n\nIn 1864, they left the Alder Gulch area of Virginia City, Montana Territory, heading north toward the Kootenai River country to pursue rumored prospects there.  En route, they heard that the Kootenai prospects had played out, and instead decided to prospect the Little Blackfoot River.  They crossed the Continental Divide to the Prickly Pear Creek drainage, still finding only minimal signs of gold at best.  Noting a small creek in the Prickly Pear Valley with the best prospects so far, they again moved north to explore the Marias River.  Still finding little gold after six weeks of hard work, they returned south to the place they referred to as Last Chance Gulch, since it would be their final opportunity on a long, arduous prospecting trip.  They were prepared to give up on the whole area.\n\nOn July 14, 1864, they dug two prospect pits on Last Chance Gulch upstream from their earlier efforts.  Both pits revealed flat gold nuggets and gold dust.  All their efforts had finally paid off.  Eventually, Crab and Cowan were sent back to Virginia City for more supplies, other prospectors began appearing, and the Last Chance Gulch bonanza began.\n\nIn 1867, the Four Georgians finally sold out their claims and took $40,000 of gold dust by wagon to Fort Benton to board a steam boat down the Missouri River and eventually all the way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia where they cashed in three years of hard labor in the Montana gold fields.", "title": "Four Georgians"}

{"text": "The Klondike Gold Rush was a migration by an estimated 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike region of the Yukon, in north-western Canada, between 1896 and 1899. Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year, it triggered a stampede of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in popular culture, e.g., in artifacts, films, games, literature, and photographs.\n\nTo reach the gold fields, most prospectors took the route through the ports of Dyea and Skagway, in Southeast Alaska. Here, the Klondikers could follow either the Chilkoot or the White Pass trails to the Yukon River, and sail down to the Klondike. The Canadian authorities required each of them to bring a year's supply of food, in order to prevent starvation. In all, the Klondikers' equipment weighed close to a ton, which most carried themselves, in stages. Performing this task, and contending with the mountainous terrain and cold climate, meant those who persisted did not arrive until summer 1898. Once there, they found few opportunities, and many left disappointed.\n\nMining was challenging, as the ore was distributed unevenly, and permafrost made\ndigging slow. Consequently, some miners chose to buy and sell claims, build up huge investments, and let others do the work. \n\nTo accommodate the prospectors, boom towns sprang up along the routes. At their terminus, Dawson City was founded at the confluence of the Klondike and the Yukon Rivers. From a population of 500 in 1896, the town grew to house approximately 30,000 people by summer 1898. Built of wood, isolated, and unsanitary, Dawson suffered from fires, high prices, and epidemics. \n\nDespite this, the wealthiest prospectors spent extravagantly, gambling and drinking in the saloons. The Native H\u00e4n people, on the other hand, suffered from the rush; they were forcibly moved into a reserve to make way for the stampeders, and many died.\n\nFrom 1898, the newspapers that had encouraged so many to travel to the Klondike lost interest in it. In the summer of 1899, gold was discovered around Nome in west Alaska, and many prospectors left the Klondike for the new goldfields, marking the end of the Klondike Rush. The boom towns declined, and the population of Dawson City fell. \n\nGold mining production in the Klondike peaked in 1903, after heavier equipment was brought in. Since then, the Klondike has been mined on and off, and today the legacy draws tourists to the region and contributes to its prosperity.", "title": "Klondike Gold Rush"}
{"text": "The miners' strike of 1984\u201385 was a major industrial action to shut down the British coal industry in an attempt to prevent colliery closures. It was led by Arthur Scargill of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) against the National Coal Board (NCB), a government agency. Opposition to the strike was led by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who wanted to reduce the power of the trade unions.\n\nThe NUM was divided over the action and many mineworkers, especially in the Midlands, worked through the dispute. Few major trade unions supported the NUM, primarily because of the absence of a vote at national level. Violent confrontations between flying pickets and police characterised the year-long strike, which ended in a decisive victory for the Conservative government and allowed the closure of most of Britain's collieries. It was \"the most bitter industrial dispute in British history\".  At its height, the strike involved 142,000 mineworkers.  The number of person-days of work lost to the strike was over 26,000,000, making it the largest since the 1926 general strike.  The journalist Seumas Milne said of the strike, \"it has no real parallel \u2013 in size, duration and impact \u2013 anywhere in the world\".\n\nThe NCB was encouraged to gear itself towards reduced subsidies in the early 1980s. After a strike was narrowly averted in February 1981, pit closures and pay restraint led to unofficial strikes. The main strike started on 6 March 1984 with a walkout at Cortonwood Colliery, which led to the NUM's Yorkshire area's sanctioning of a strike on the grounds of a ballot result from 1981 in the Yorkshire Area, which was later challenged in court. The union strategy was to cause a severe energy shortage of the sort that had won victory in the 1972 strike. The government strategy, designed by Margaret Thatcher, was threefold: to build up ample coal stocks, to keep as many miners at work as possible, and to use police to break up attacks by pickets on working miners. The critical element was the NUM's failure to hold a national strike ballot.David Howell, et al. \"Goodbye to all that?: A Review of Literature on the 1984/5 Miners' Strike.\" Work, Employment & Society (1987) 1#3 pp.  388\u2013404 in JSTORR.R.

It ended on 3 March 1985. It was a defining moment in British industrial relations, the NUM's defeat significantly weakening the trade union movement. It was a major victory for Thatcher and the Conservative Party, with the Thatcher government able to consolidate their economically liberal programme. The number of strikes fell sharply in 1985 as a result of the \"demonstration effect\" and trade union power in general diminished. Three deaths resulted from events related to the strike.\n\nThe much-reduced coal industry was privatised in December 1994, ultimately becoming UK Coal. In 1983, Britain had 174 working pits, but by 2009 there were only six.

{"text": "A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust.\n\nCrushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated. Crushing is the process of transferring a force amplified by mechanical advantage through a material made of molecules that bond together more strongly, and resist deformation more, than those in the material being crushed do. Crushing devices hold material between two parallel or tangent solid surfaces, and apply sufficient force to bring the surfaces together to generate enough energy within the material being crushed so that its molecules separate from (fracturing), or change alignment in relation to (deformation), each other. The earliest crushers were hand-held stones, where the weight of the stone provided a boost to muscle power, used against a stone anvil.

{"text": "The Battle of Orgreave was a  violent confrontation on 18 June 1984 between police and pickets at a British Steel Corporation (BSC) coking plant in Orgreave, in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. It was a pivotal event in the 1984\u201385 UK miners' strike, and one of the most violent clashes in British industrial history. Alastair Stewart has characterised it as \"a defining and ghastly moment\" that \"changed, forever, the conduct of industrial relations and how this country functions as an economy and as a democracy\". Historian Tristram Hunt (a former Labour MP) has described the confrontation as \"almost medieval in its choreography ... at various stages a siege, a battle, a chase, a rout and, finally, a brutal example of legalised state violence\".  Most media reports at the time depicted it as \"an act of self-defence by police who had come under attack\", and there still exists a body of opinion that the police at Orgreave \"were upholding the law in the face of intimidation from thousands of strikers\".\n\nFollowing the confrontation, 71 pickets were charged with riot and 24 with violent disorder. At the time, riot was punishable by life imprisonment. The trials collapsed when the evidence given by the police was deemed \"unreliable\". Gareth Peirce, who acted as solicitor for some of the men, said that the charge of riot had been used \"to make a public example of people, as a device to assist in breaking the strike\", while Mansfield called it \"the worst example of a mass frame-up in this country this century\". In June 1991, South Yorkshire Police paid \u00a3425,000 in compensation to 39 miners for assault, wrongful arrest, unlawful detention and malicious prosecution. \n\nIn 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission reported that there was \"evidence of excessive violence by police officers, a false narrative from police exaggerating violence by miners, perjury by officers giving evidence to prosecute the arrested men, and an apparent coverup of that perjury by senior officers\". Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, admitted that the police had been \"dangerously close to being used as an instrument of state\". Following the 2016 inquest verdict into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, previously censored documents suggesting links between the actions of senior South Yorkshire Police officers at both incidents were published. This led to renewed calls for a public inquiry to be held into the actions of the police at Orgreave. In October 2016, Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced there would be no statutory inquiry or independent review in an Oral Answer to a Question in the House of Commons, in a written ministerial statement to the House of Commons and Lords, and in a letter to the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC).", "title": "Battle of Orgreave"}

By 2014, coal mining had largely shifted to open pit mines in Wyoming, and there were only 60,000 active coal miners.  The UMW was left with 35,000 members, of whom 20,000 were coal miners, chiefly in underground mines in Kentucky and West Virginia.

Edited by John M. Laslett 1994 Adopting the model of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), the union was initially established as a three-pronged labor tool: to develop mine safety; to improve mine workers' independence from the mine owners and the company store; and to provide miners with collective bargaining power.\n\nAfter passage of the National Recovery Act in 1933 during the Great Depression, organizers spread throughout the United States to organize all coal miners into labor unions.  Under the powerful leadership of John L. Lewis, the UMW broke with the American Federation of Labor and set up its own federation, the CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations). Its organizers fanned out to organize major industries, including automobiles, steel, electrical equipment, rubber, paint and chemical, and fought a series of battles with the AFL. The UMW grew to 800,000 members and was an element in the New Deal Coalition supporting Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Lewis broke with Roosevelt in 1940 and left the CIO, leaving the UMW increasingly isolated in the labor movement.

Ludlow was the deadliest single incident in the southern Colorado Coal Strike, which lasted from September 1913 through December 1914.  The strike was organized by the miners against coal mining companies in Colorado. The three largest companies involved were Colorado Fuel & Iron Company, owned by the powerful Rockefeller family; Rocky Mountain Fuel Company, and Victor-American Fuel Company.\n\nIn retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow, the miners armed themselves and attacked dozens of anti-union establishments over the next ten days, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 40-mile front from Trinidad to Walsenburg.\"Ludlow Massacre\", Denver University An estimated 69 to 199 deaths occurred during the entire strike.

Other major events in the city's history include the 1917 Speculator Mine disaster, the largest hard rock mining disaster in world history.\n\nOver the course of its history, Butte's mining and smelting operations generated an excess of $48 billion worth of ore, but also resulted in numerous environmental implications for the city: The upper Clark Fork River, with headwaters at Butte, is the largest Superfund site in the United States, and the city is also home to the Berkeley Pit.

It is the first volume of The Baroque Cycle, his late Baroque historical fiction series, succeeded by The Confusion and The System of the World (both published in 2004). Quicksilver won the Arthur C. Clarke Award  and was nominated for the Locus Award in 2004. Stephenson organized the structure of Quicksilver such that chapters have been incorporated into three internal books titled \"Quicksilver\", \"The King of the Vagabonds\", and \"Odalisque\". In 2006, each internal book was released in separate paperback editions,  to make the 900 pages more approachable for readers. These internal books were originally independent novels within the greater cycle during composition.\n\nThe novel Quicksilver is written in various narrative styles, such as theatrical staging and epistolary, and follows a large group of characters. Though mostly set in England, France, and the United Provinces in the period 1655 through 1673, the first book includes a frame story set in late 1713 Massachusetts. In order to write the novel, Stephenson researched the period extensively and integrates events and historical themes important to historical scholarship throughout the novel. However, Stephenson alters details such as the members of the Cabal ministry, the historical cabinet of Charles II of England, to facilitate the incorporation of his fictional characters. Within the historical context, Stephenson also deals with many themes which pervade his other works, including the exploration of knowledge, communication and cryptography.\n\nThe plot of the first and third books focus on Daniel Waterhouse's exploits as a natural philosopher and friend to the young Isaac Newton and his later observations of English politics and religion, respectively.  The second book introduces the vagabond Jack Shaftoe (\"King of the Vagabonds\") and Eliza (a former member of a Turkish harem) as they cross Europe, eventually landing in the Netherlands, where Eliza becomes entangled in commerce and politics.

It received an official title in 1884.  Hodgkinson became Australia's Father of Forestry.  Carr was confronted with a population explosion upon opening of the Yarra goldfields in 1859 amid economic depression and was honoured for dutiful administration of the law despite public protests against him.  Carr was also Secretary to the Government Inquiry into the Eureka Stockade 3 December 1854 at Ballarat.  Charles Warburton Carr never lived in Warburton, he lived in Avoca.\n\nHodgkinson's influence is extensively documented.  He is Australia's Father of Forestry.

The sketch map of the upper Yarra water and new bridle track to Woods Point, from Lillydale to Traveller's rest on great mountain road, lithographed at Office of Lands and Survey, 11 Sept. 1865, is available online at the State Library of Victoria.  In a letter to The Argus 1 July 1911, Panton stated, \"having ascertained from the chief and head of the aboriginal tribe of the Yering valley that the mountain was known as 'Donna Buang' I at once entered that name. My map was published by the Crown Lands department on the original scale of two miles to the inch.\"  Panton was Colonel Anderson's nephew; both good friends with Melbourne Botanic Gardens creator Baron Von Mueller and Hodgkinson.\n\nThe upper Yarra has a fairy-tale quality.  The last major town before Warburton, Lillydale, has similar polar histories, an evidence base that shows that Hodgkinson named the town after Lilly de Castella, daughter of Colonel Joseph Anderson who served as one of the first nominated members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly in the 1850s, and another history, proposes it was named by public servant clerk John Hardy who heard convicts singing when building a road (www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00855b.htm)!

Spawned by the success of the silver mining operations in the nearby Cerro Gordo Mines in the late 1860s, Swansea became a hub for smelting the ore and transporting the resulting ingots to Los Angeles, over 200 miles away.

{"text": "Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores. The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.\n\nAs in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated). The processing techniques depend on the nature of the ore. If the ore is primarily sulfide copper minerals (such as chalcopyrite), the ore is crushed and ground to liberate the valuable minerals from the waste ('gangue') minerals. It is then concentrated using mineral flotation. The concentrate is typically then sold to distant smelters, although some large mines have smelters located nearby. Such colocation of mines and smelters was more typical in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when smaller smelters could be economic. The sulfide concentrates are typically smelted in such furnaces as the Outokumpo or Inco flash furnace or the ISASMELT furnace to produce matte, which must be converted and refined to produce anode copper. Finally, the final refining process is electrolysis. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed. Sulfur dioxide gas, for example, is captured and turned into sulfuric acid \u2014 which can then be used in the extraction process or sold for such purposes as fertiliser manufacture.\n\nOxidised copper ores can be treated by hydrometallurgical extraction.", "title": "Copper extraction"}

Herbert wrote five sequels, and the first two were presented as a miniseries in 2003. The Dune universe has also inspired some traditional games and a series of video games. Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-world nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan.\n\nFrank Herbert died in 1986. Beginning in 1999, his son Brian Herbert and science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson published a number of prequel novels, as well as two which complete the original Dune series (Hunters of Dune in 2006 and Sandworms of Dune in 2007), partially based on Frank Herbert's notes discovered a decade after his death.\n\nThe political, scientific, and social fictional setting of Herbert's novels and derivative works is known as the Dune universe, or Duniverse.

{"text": "Girdwood is a resort town within the southern extent of the Municipality of Anchorage in the state of Alaska.  Located near the end of the Turnagain Arm of Cook Inlet, Girdwood lies in a valley in the southwestern Chugach Mountains, surrounded by seven glaciers feeding into a number of creeks, which either converge within the valley or empty directly into the arm.  Girdwood is typically accessed by the Seward Highway (Milepost 90), with the main line of the Alaska Railroad paralleling the highway.  By road distance, most of the community lies within  of downtown Anchorage.  According to 2014 estimates, a little under 2,000 people live in the valley.\n\nFounded as a community to supply miners during the Turnagain Arm gold rushes of the 1890s, Girdwood was mostly a small, quiet place until the middle of the 20th century.  Two events drastically altered that.  The first was the establishment of Alyeska Resort along the slopes of Mount Alyeska, which became an international destination coincidental with Anchorage's civic promotion of itself as \"The Air Crossroads of the World\".  The second was the 1964 earthquake, which devastated the original townsite located directly along the arm.  Following the earthquake, most of the town moved further up the valley to a new townsite, though a few homes remained and a strip mall was later constructed along the Seward Highway.  Historically dominated in the years since the resort's opening by seasonally-occupied vacation homes and seasonal activity at the resort, the opening of the Alyeska Prince Hotel during the 1990s has shifted the resort, and hence Girdwood as a whole, more towards year-round activity and a year-round economy.  This has led to periodic debates about community growth and affordability of housing for resort workers, many of whom over the years have resorted to camping illegally on public lands.\n\nGirdwood still revolves heavily around seasonal activity, with skiing and snowboarding at Alyeska Resort bringing visitors and their money into the community.  Summer activities are also popular, which include hiking, fishing and rafting.  The Girdwood Forest Fair, held every July, is the community's most significant visitor attraction apart from resort-related activities.

{"text": "Bootleg mining or shoemaker mining is illegal coal mining.  \n\nThe term originated around the 1920s, though the practice probably predates that. Generally, a bootleg mine (sometimes called a Bootleg Pit) is a small mine dug by a handful of men. Often this took place surreptitiously on land owned by somebody else, such as a coal company.  They were frequently dug by coal miners off official tunnels in order to procure additional, free coal for themselves, a practice that causes additional ramifications when fighting mine fires. Sometimes small pits are hidden under houses or outbuildings.  Usually, the mine is not large enough to turn around in. The pits are known for being unsafe, and often causing collapse.\n\nThe practice has died away in the United States; an American with simple equipment cannot dig enough coal in a day to reach a living wage.  Bootleg mines in China are still very common, as are the fatalities resulting from unregulated mining.", "title": "Bootleg mining"}

{"text": "The Consolidated Mine was a gold mine in Lumpkin County, Georgia, United States, just east of Dahlonega. Like most of the area around Dahlonega, the placer mining on the land on which the mine is located probably started during the Georgia Gold Rush. By 1880, the placer deposits were exhausted and the land was down to hard rock. Gold was soon discovered in a huge quartz vein system, and mined. \"The richest acre\" was mined deep into the ground, and the resulting shaft became known as the \"Glory Hole.\u201d\n\nAfter an interruption of operations at the mine, a group of investors purchased about 7,000 acres (28\u00a0km\u00b2) of land around the discovery sight and formed the Dahlonega Consolidated Gold Mining Co. in 1895. After constructing the largest stamp mill east of the Mississippi River at the Consolidated Mine property, the Mining Co. folded in 1906. The mine's lower workings became flooded and lay dormant until seventy-five years later, when the site came under new ownership.\n\nThere is still gold to be mined here \u2013 but the cost of extracting the gold from the mine exceeds the value of the gold, at least for the time being.

{"text": "Rhyolite is a ghost town in Nye County, in the U.S. state of Nevada. It is in the Bullfrog Hills, about  northwest of Las Vegas, near the eastern edge of Death Valley. The town began in early 1905 as one of several mining camps that sprang up after a prospecting discovery in the surrounding hills. During an ensuing gold rush, thousands of gold-seekers, developers, miners and service providers flocked to the Bullfrog Mining District. Many settled in Rhyolite, which lay in a sheltered desert basin near the region's biggest producer, the Montgomery Shoshone Mine.\n\nIndustrialist Charles M. Schwab bought the Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and invested heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and railroad transportation, that served the town as well as the mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907\u201308.\n\nRhyolite declined almost as rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 made it more difficult to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.\n\nAfter 1920, Rhyolite and its ruins became a tourist attraction and a setting for motion pictures. Most of its buildings crumbled, were salvaged for building materials, or were moved to nearby Beatty or other towns, although the railway depot and a house made chiefly of empty bottles were repaired and preserved. From 1988 to 1998, three companies operated a profitable open-pit mine at the base of Ladd Mountain, about  south of Rhyolite.

{"text": "The Powder River Basin is a geologic structural basin in southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming, about  east to west and  north to south, known for its coal deposits. The region supplies about 40 percent of coal in the United States. It is both a topographic drainage and geologic structural basin. The basin is so named because it is drained by the Powder River, although it is also drained in part by the Cheyenne River, Tongue River, Bighorn River, Little Missouri River, Platte River, and their tributaries.\n\nWhile the Powder River Basin is unified geologically, residents of areas distant from the Powder River proper do not think of themselves as living in a single geographic region. For example, residents of the Crow Reservation in the Big Horn River watershed, or of Sheridan in the Tongue River watershed, would locate the Powder River Basin as the region east of the Big Horn Mountains, using a definition based on watershed and topography.\n\nMajor cities in the area include Gillette and Sheridan, Wyoming and Miles City, Montana. Outside of these main towns, the area is very sparsely populated and is known for its rolling grasslands and semiarid climate. The former hunting grounds of the Oglala Lakota, it has become the single largest source of coal mined in the United States, and contains one of the largest deposits of coal in the world. Most of the active coal mining in the Powder River Basin actually takes place in drainages of the Cheyenne River. Because of the Powder River Basin, Wyoming has been the top coal-producing state in the United States since 1988. In 2007, the Powder River Basin alone produced 436 million short tons (396 million tonnes) of coal, more than twice the production of second-place West Virginia, and more than the entire Appalachian region.

{"text": "A stacker is a large machine used in bulk material handling. Its function is to pile bulk material such as limestone, ores and cereals on to a stockpile. A reclaimer can be used to recover the material.\n\nGold dredges in Alaska had a stacker that was a fixed part of the dredge.  It carried over-size material to the tailings pile.\n\nStackers are nominally rated for capacity in tonnes per hour (tph). They normally travel on a rail between stockpiles in the stockyard.  A stacker can usually move in at least two directions: horizontally along the rail and vertically by luffing (raising and lowering) its boom.  Luffing of the boom minimises dust by reducing the distance that material such as coal needs to fall to the top of the stockpile.  The boom is luffed upwards as the height of the stockpile increases. Some stackers can rotate the boom.  This allows a single stacker to form two stockpiles, one on either side of the conveyor.\n\nStackers are used to stack in different patterns, such as cone stacking and chevron stacking.  Stacking in a single cone tends to cause size segregation, with coarser material moving out towards the base.  In raw cone ply stacking, additional cones are added next to the first cone.  In chevron stacking, the stacker travels along the length of the stockpile adding layer upon layer of material.\n\nStackers and reclaimers were originally manually controlled, with no means of remote control.  Modern machines are typically semi-automatic or fully automated, with parameters remotely set. The control system used is typically a programmable logic controller, with a human-machine interface for display, connected to a central control system.\n\nOther than stacking, a stacker has three basic movements:\n Luffing: This is vertical movement. Stackers use either a winch mechanism with metal wire, or hydraulic cylinders, generally two. Winch mechanisms are highly reliable compared to hydraulic actuators and remain widely used, particularly in large stackers.\n Travelling: The stacker moves on a rail track, which may be broad or narrow gauge, enabling it to move around the stockyard as required. For this purpose, traction motors powered by direct current (DC) are connected by bevel gears to between 12 and 22 wheels. For manual control, all the controls are in a controller's cabin above the boom conveyor or boom. Modern stackers can be controlled remotely.\n Slewing: This is rotation of the stacker around its central axis to align or place the stockpile where required. This works mostly by a slew pinion that rotates around a slew base. This type of gear assembly is called a sun and planet gear. The axles may be multiple and are driven by DC-powered axle motors which transmit the torque via bevel or helical gears.\n\nThe conveyor belts used in stackers may be made of fabric or metal wire, depending upon the material to be handled. They are driven by pulleys, which in turn are driven by DC motors. The motors and gear are coupled by fluid coupling.\n\nMost stackers are electrically powered by way of a trailing cable. There are basically two types of cable trailing: power cord rotating drum (PCRD) and control cable rotating drum (CCRD). Pendulum adjustments are made to ensure the proper alignment of these cables while the stacker is travelling.", "title": "Stacker"}

{"text": "Wittenoom is a declared contaminated site and former townsite 1,420 kilometres (687\u00a0mi) north-north-east of Perth in the Hamersley Range in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.\n\nThe area around Wittenoom was mainly pastoral until the 1930s when mining for blue asbestos began in the area. By 1939, major mining began in Yampire Gorge, which was subsequently closed in 1943 when mining began in Wittenoom Gorge. In 1947 a company town was built, and by the 1950s it was Pilbara's largest town. During the 1950s and early 1960s Wittenoom was Australia's only supplier of blue asbestos. The mine was shut down in 1966 due to unprofitability and growing health concerns from asbestos mining in the area.\n\nToday, three residents still live in the town, which receives no government services. In December 2006, the Government of Western Australia announced that the town's official status would be removed, and in June 2007, Jon Ford, the Minister for Regional Development, announced that the townsite had officially been degazetted. The town's name was removed from official maps and road signs and the Shire of Ashburton is able to close roads that lead to contaminated areas.\n\nThe Wittenoom steering committee met in April 2013 to finalise closure of the town, limit access to the area and raise awareness of the risks. Details of how that would be achieved were to be determined but it would likely necessitate removing the town's remaining residents, converting freehold land to crown land, demolishing houses and closing or rerouting roads.

{"text": "Greenvale is a nickel mining settlement in Queensland, Australia,  approximately  northwest of Townsville.  Other metal ores are also extracted there. It is located within the Charters Towers Region.\n\nIt lies on the banks of the Burdekin River and on the Gregory Developmental Road. A good sealed road crosses the hills over to Townsville. An ore-carrying railway line ran between Greenvale and Queensland Nickel Industries (QNI) processing plant at Yabulu, approximately  north of Townsville from 1974 to 1993. Greenvale Post Office opened on 1 November 1973. Some of the longest trains in Australia were pulled along this. The railway line tracks were removed in mid-2000; however the bridges, cuttings, blue metal and easement remain. Occasionally people walk from Yabulu to Greenvale along it, as a form of fundraising.\nDespite the fact that the mine itself has since concluded operations, more mining operations around the area have since commenced and homes are all fully occupied with workers supporting the regional mining and exploration.\n\nGreenvale's population is approximately 150; however, when the nickel mine was in operation, its population was roughly estimated to be 3,000. The 2006 Census Data states that 255 people were living in the Greenvale statistical division of the Dalrymple shire.\n\nThere are no real sights at Greenvale; the nearest site of interest would be Undara Volcanic National Park approximately  to the north, however the town is a snapshot of life in 1973 so it's a point of interest for many passing tourists.\n\nThe Three Rivers Hotel, made famous by Slim Dusty in a song by the same name, is now located at Greenvale.  This is not the actual hotel where the song was penned by Stan Coster.  The hotel reference is actually to the \"Mess Hall\" at the construction camp where Stan Coster penned the song.  Stan worked as Grader operator for Thiess Brothers on the construction of the railway line. The origin of the name \"Three Rivers Hotel\" is not because the \"hotel\" was ever at the junction of the three rivers - Burdekin, Star and Clarke as stated on numerous web sites.  The lyrics mentions the camp at the Star River.  This was one of 6 camps that existed on the length of the Greenvale line .  During 1974 North Queensland was severely drenched by a very active wet season and work on the railway line ceased for days, even weeks, on end.  The workers in the camps had nothing better to do than spend the day in the camp \"boozer\". Each camp had a boozer which was a basic demountable building with outdoor covered seating. During one of these wet days the water started to enter the confines of the boozer and immediately some of the men started digging some improvised drainage around the boozer to channel away the water. As they built the channels, some wags named them after the 3 main rivers (Burdekin, Star and Clarke). These were joined up roughly as they do in real life and the boozer named \"the Three Rivers Hotel\".  One of the drinkers that day was Stan Coster who penned the song on the spot in the bar and performed it for the drinkers.  The three rivers referred in the song do not join up at one point but the Star and the Clarke join the Burdekin at completely separate locations and therefore there could be no hotel on the \"junction\" of the three rivers the song refers to.\n\nThere is a 9-hole golf course, caravan park and general store/mini supermarket. The hotel serves meals and has a number of self-contained units once used by the mine to house staff and contractors.", "title": "Greenvale, Queensland"}

{"text": "Gambleside is an abandoned village located in northern Rossendale close to the boundary with Burnley's Dunnockshaw and Clowbridge parish.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages Gambleside was one of the cow farms (vaccary) of Rossendale Forest, belonging to the Honour of Clitheroe.

{"text": "The Colorado Silver Boom was a dramatic expansionist period of silver mining activity in the U.S. state of Colorado in the late 19th century. The boom started in 1879 with the discovery of silver at Leadville. Over 82 million dollars worth of silver was mined during the period, making it the second great mineral boom in the state, and coming twenty years after the earlier and shorter Colorado Gold Rush of 1859.  The boom was largely the consequence of large-scale purchases of silver by the United States Government authorized by Congress in 1878. The boom endured throughout the 1880s, resulting in an intense increase in both the population and wealth of Colorado, especially in the mountains.  It came to an end in 1893 in the wake of the collapse of silver prices caused by the repeal of Sherman Silver Purchase Act.Voynick, S.M., 1992, Colorado Gold, Missoula: Mountain Press Publishing Company, \n\nSilver had been discovered in Colorado in the 1860s, with early mining in Clear Creek Canyon at Georgetown in 1864. In the early days, the mineral was overshadowed by gold, however, and the low price of mineral meant that most mines were not profitable enough to operate. In 1878, responding to pressure from western interests, the United States Congress passed the Bland\u2013Allison Act authorizing the free coinage of silver. The government demand raised the price of the metal to the point where many additional mines were profitable. The discovery of the Leadville district the following year resulted in a flood of new emigrant prospectors to many of the same mountain gullies that had been the site of the gold rush. The resulting opulence was most lavish in Leadville itself.  The repeal of the Sherman Act in 1893 conversely led to a collapse of silver prices, bringing out an end to the boom as well.\n\nBeginning in 1889, Creede, Colorado was the site of another big silver boom.\nThe first discovery was made at the Alpha mine in 1869, but the silver could not be extracted at a profit from the complex ores. The great \u201cBoom Days\u201d started with the discovery of rich minerals in Willow Creek Canyon. The town leapt from a population of 600 in 1889 to more than 10,000 people in December 1891. The mines operated continuously until 1995.  Creede was the last silver boom town in Colorado in the 19th century.\n\n\nThe boom continued unabated throughout the 1880s and early 90s, years that gave the state many of the historic structures in its cities and towns. The boom also drove many extensions of the railway network in the mountains, including such lines as the Denver, South Park and Pacific, which built an early narrow-gauge line to Leadville. Likewise the extension of the railroad network up the Roaring Fork Valley to the previously failed mining town of Aspen in the late 1880s made the extraction of silver ore there economically feasible, and saved the town from near extinction.\n\nThe government purchases of silver were subsequently nearly doubled by the 1890 Sherman Silver Purchase Act, further extending the boom into the early 1890s.  The repeal of the act in 1893 resulted in a collapse of silver prices, bringing about an end to the boom. After 1893, many mining camps became ghost towns. The accompanying collapse in statewide economic activity was ameliorated somewhat by the simultaneous emergence of agriculture, previously derided as not feasible, as a large component of the state economy.\n\nThe working conditions inside the mines were often very dangerous. Silicosis  which, at the time, was incurable, ruined miners' lungs quickly. Many other hazards existed. Apart from the lanterns or tallow candles the miners carried, the mines were otherwise completely dark. Miners at the time were also subject to the threat of tunnel collapse, flooding and the lack of oxygen in the deeper areas of the mines. Often the miners brought caged canaries down with them; when the bird passed out, it indicated that the oxygen levels were dangerously low in the area. Mines were commonly very small and tightly spaced to save on the cost, effort and time it would take to expand the tunnels, and so resulted in the use of people of smaller stature and even children.", "title": "Colorado Silver Boom"}
{"text": "Welsh gold is gold that occurs naturally in two distinct areas of Wales and highly prized because of its origin and scarcity.

Open from May 15 through October 15, the museum is a historic reconstruction of a mining town from the days of the Colorado Gold Rush and the later Colorado Silver Boom in South Park in the late 1850s through the 1880s.South Park City - Tour Guide, South Park Historical Foundation\n\nThe museum contains thirty-five authentic relocated buildings filled with over 60,000 artifacts that depict many of the economic and social aspects of life in a gold or silver mining town in Colorado in the late 19th century. Two of the buildings, the South Park Brewery and the Summer Saloon, are listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nA log structure known as \"Father Dyer\u2019s Chapel\" was a hotel in Montgomery, Colorado but was dismantled, moved to Fairplay, and rebuilt as a church in 1868. It is named for John Lewis Dyer, the itinerant Methodist clergyman who preached in the area from 1861 to 1877 and is one of the sixteen founders of Colorado memoralized in the Colorado State Capitol in Denver.\n\nThe museum was opened in 1959 after two years of preparation by the South Park Historical Foundation. It is open daily from mid-May to mid-October.\n\nOn the second weekend of August, South Park City hosts Living History Days in which volunteers in period dress perform the role of 19th-century townspeople. Living History Days romanticizes the vices of frontier America, such as playing Faro, which became popular during the California gold rush of 1849. It is illegal to play faro for money in all fifty states because the odds favor the players.

Capel has a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and cool wet winters.  Daily temperatures range from 13\u00a0\u00b0C to 40\u00a0\u00b0C in summer, and from 5\u00a0\u00b0C to 27\u00a0\u00b0C in winter.  Average annual rainfall is about 830\u00a0mm.\n\nHistorically, Capel is a farming area; traditional agricultural pursuits include dairy and beef.  In recent times, Capel has become popular for hobby farms, and a number of innovative agricultural pursuits have been introduced, including alpacas, viticulture, aquaculture and growing of blue gums.  There is also some mining of mineral sands in the Shire, and tourism is increasingly important to the Shire's economy.\n\nThe Capel area was settled very early in the history of colonial Western Australia.  The Capel River was discovered by Frederick Ludlow in 1834, but it was not named until the Bussell family settled in the area.  The name honours Capel Carter Brockman (1839\u20131924),'Brockman, Capel Carter (1839\u20131924)', Obituaries Australia, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 7 April 2013. daughter of John Bussell (1803\u20131875),Freda Vines Carmody (1966) 'Bussell, John Garrett (1803\u20131875)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, (MUP) who was named after a Miss Capel Carter, a cousin of the Bussells in England with whom Bussell family members corresponded. In the 1830s a number of settlers followed the Bussells into the area, and both James Stirling and John Hutt, (the first two Governors of Western Australia) took up land in the region.  Plans to establish a townsite in the area were first mooted in 1844, but the site was not surveyed until the 1870s and lots were not sold until 1897.  Initially the town was named Coolingnup, which is the Noongar Aboriginal name for the place; the name was changed to Capel in 1899.\n\nThe population of the town was 91 (44 males and 47 females) in 1898.\n\nWestralian Sands was established in 1954 but commenced operations in 1959 when it started mining and processing the Yoganup deposit just north of the town. Another company, RGC, operated a mine to the south of the town. In 1998 both companies merged to form Iluka Resources which continues to operate ilmenite mines around the area and produce synthetic rutile at the processing facility to the north of the town along the Bussell Highway.", "title": "Capel, Western Australia"}

It was named after a woman in the miners camp called Elizabeth Stark Blakesley.Elizabethtown Pioneer Trails 1927 Monument Speech - 79.29 (29th submission submitted to county museum in 1979) - Plumas County Museum\n\nIt is said that the value of gold taken from the Elizabethtown area ran into the millions of dollars. It was started from other gold mining camps all around American Valley (where Quincy, CA is now located). In 1852, a 10 to 15 family wagon train came up Beckwourth Pass (which was created by James Beckwourth, the first pioneer to this area). They brought a large supply of horses, oxen, cows, and other needed supplies and were the first settlers of American Valley. When they got there, they found a population of hundreds of Maidu Indians, which were peaceful and friendly.\n\nIn 1852 Alexander and Frank Tate discovered gold in what is known as Tate ravine. After that, Lewis Stark, Peter Day, and George Ferrier one morning went up Elizabeth ravine and by noon they panned out an ounce of gold. After dinner they found several ounces using a rocker. After digging a small ditch, they discovered one 28 ounce gold piece. After that many miners came to search for gold which developed into a village. Later on Elizabethtown was also known as Betysburg after a rivalry started with Quincy. The winter of 1852 and 1853 were very harsh with low provisions. So the spring of 1853 the Stark family went to Sacramento Valley and hauled up many cattle for beef for the starving families.Pages 276 and 277 of \"Reproduction of Fariss and Smith's History of Plumas, Lassen & Sierra Counties, California, 1882; and biographical sketches of their prominent men and pioneers.

{"text": "A cave-in is a collapse of a geologic formation, mine or structure which may occur during mining or tunneling. Geologic structures prone to spontaneous cave-ins include alvar, tsingy and other limestone formations, but can also include lava tubes and a variety of other subsurface rock formations. Glacier caves and other ice formations are very prone to collapse from exposure to warm temperatures or running water.\n\nIn mining, the term roof fall is used to refer to many types of collapses, ranging from the fall of a single flake of shale to collapses that form sink holes that reach to the surface. However, roof falls in mining are not all accidental. In longwall mining and retreat mining, miners systematically remove all support from under large areas of the mine roof, allowing it to settle just beyond the work area. The goal in such mining methods is not to prevent roof fall and the ensuing surface subsidence, but rather to control it.", "title": "Cave-in"}

{"text": "Drilling and blasting is the controlled use of explosives and other methods such as gas pressure blasting pyrotechnics, to break rock for excavation. It is practiced most often in mining, quarrying and civil engineering such as dam, tunnel or road construction. The result of rock blasting is often known as a rock cut.\n\nDrilling and blasting currently utilizes many different varieties of explosives with different compositions and performance properties.  Higher velocity explosives are used for relatively hard rock in order to shatter and break the rock, while low velocity explosives are used in soft rocks to generate more gas pressure and a greater heaving effect. For instance, an early 20th-century blasting manual compared the effects of black powder to that of a wedge, and dynamite to that of a hammer. The most commonly used explosives in mining today are ANFO based blends due to lower cost than dynamite.\n\nBefore the advent of tunnel boring machines (TBMs), drilling and blasting was the only economical way of excavating long tunnels through hard rock, where digging is not possible. Even today, the method is still used in the construction of tunnels, such as in the construction of the L\u00f6tschberg Base Tunnel. The decision whether to construct a tunnel using a TBM or using a drill and blast method includes a number of factors.  Tunnel length is a key issue that needs to be addressed because large TBMs for a rock tunnel have a high capital cost, but because they are usually quicker than a drill and blast tunnel the price per metre of tunnel is lower. This means that shorter tunnels tend to be less economical to construct with a TBM and are therefore usually constructed by drill and blast. Managing ground conditions can also have a significant effect on the choice with different methods suited to different hazards in the ground.", "title": "Drilling and blasting"}

The Kennedy Mining Company was formed in 1860 when he and three partners began digging shafts near today's mine property entrance. The mine operated sporadically until it closed in 1878. In 1886 fifteen people invested $97,600 to reopen the mine under the corporate entity of the Kennedy Mining and Milling Company.\n\nIn 1898 the company began sinking a new shaft 1,950 feet (591 m) east of the original shafts. This East Shaft would eventually reach a vertical depth of 5,912 feet (1,792 m), the deepest vertical depth gold mine in North America at the time. In 1928 a surface fire burned all the structures except two.  All other buildings and foundations were built after 1928.

A coal town is a type of company town or mining community established by the employer, a mining company, which imports workers to work the mineral find.    The 'town founding' process is not limited to coal mining, nor mining, but is generally found where mineral wealth is located in a remote or undeveloped area, which is then opened for exploitation, normally first by having some transportation infrastructure brought into being first.  Often, such minerals were the result of logging operations by pushing into a wilderness forest, which clear-cutting operations then allowed geologists and cartographers, to chart and plot the lands, allowing efficient discovery of natural resources and their  exploitation.\n \nUsually, the coal camp, like the railroad camp and logging camps, began with temporary storage, housing and dining facilities \u2014tents, shanties, shacks\u2014 until more permanent dwellings could be built.  Often the first built structures were log cabin storehouses followed closely by kitchens, a lumber mill and smithies, then management offices, housing. Gradually, within a year or so, the camp grew into a community with a variety of housing types including boardinghouses for transients and new hires, all the growing community organized around a Company Store. The company would often give credit in the form of scrip, a form of token money that would discourage workers from purchasing items in stores outside the town. The store, to the wives and families joining the miners in the developing community, was perhaps \"the most essential structure in the town...\".\n\nThe coal operator, would normally divest itself of unprofitable lands as soon as possible, rather than paying land taxes, so sub-divided the tract and sold lots and eventually the housing it had built, recouping part of its capital (money) out of the unproductive property of the tract.

McGregor was cutting an access track into the mining town of Walhalla when he came across this feature. He examined the rock but failed to find any gold in it. He later showed this to a workmate William Cummin, whose sharper eyes noted that this was not the case. Cummin kept this discovery to himself and soon after he left McGregor's prospecting party and went to Seaton to register a prospecting claim on the site. He later gave McGregor a 1/8 share in this claim as a token gesture of the find.\n\nThe town's mines yielded rich gold which was easily extracted at first. The very first crushing of the Happy Go Lucky Quart Gold mine yielded an incredible 700 oz from 150 tons of rock. By May 1868 some 14,862 ozs had been obtained by the town's mines. Prominent mines included the GreyHorse, Lillydale, Union Jack, Evening Star, Wulfsode, Esmeralda and Castle Rose.\n\nBy 1864 a booming village had developed including 3 hotels, bakers, butchers, and restaurants. In addition to the area's mining activity, the town had become an important stop for the packing trade which was bringing mining equipment and other goods into nearby Walhalla.

It was founded in 1934, and in 1936 it became an affiliate of the newly formed Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM).\n\nThe SNTMMSSRM\u00b4s leaders were initially staunch allies of Vicente Lombardo Toledano, the head of the CTM. In 1949, when Lombardo Toledano left the CTM to form the rival General Union of Workers and Campesinos (UGOCM) and the Popular Party, the SNTMMSRM joined these new organizations. The unions of railroad workers (STFRM) and oil workers (STPRM) also supported Lombardo Toledano.\n\nThe ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the CTM saw Lombardo Toledano and these unions as a threat, and in the 1950 the government installed charros (corrupt labor bosses) in the leadership of the SNTMMSSRM. The most important of these charros was Napole\u00f3n G\u00f3mez Sada, who was the president of the SNTMMSSRM for decades until he was replaced by his son in 2001.\n\nThe pro-government SNTMMSSRM leaders faced little opposition from the miners' locals (except for Local 65 in Cananea, Sonora). However, a strong reform campaign was initiated in the 1970s and 1980s by steelworkers' locals.\n\nThe current leader of the SNTMMSSRM is Napole\u00f3n G\u00f3mez Urrutia, son of the long-time union president.

The FSTMB has played an important role in Bolivia's recent history.\n\nThe union emerged in the wake of a violent clash between government troops and striking tin miners in Oruro and Potos\u00ed in 1942. The FSTMB was founded on June 11, 1944 at a congress held in Huanuni, Oruro. The Huanuni Congress included delegates from 25 local unions, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR), and the Revolutionary Workers' Party (POR, a Trotskyist group). The newly formed union had a membership of 60,000 miners. Juan Lech\u00edn, the leader of the miners' movement and POR member, was chosen as the union's Executive Secretary.\n\nDivisions emerged in the union's leadership over how to relate to the new government of Major Gualberto Villarroel. MNR members wanted the FSTMB to support Major Villarroel, but the Lech\u00edn and the other members of the POR wanted the union to remain independent of the government. The MNR's position was defeated in 1946 when the FSTMB adopted the \"Pulacayo Thesis,\" which called for a workers' revolution and other radical goals. In 1947, POR members formed a caucus in the union, the Bloque Parlamentario Minero, to represent their interests. The FSTMB faced renewed government suppression following a series of strikes in 1949, forcing Lech\u00edn and other union leaders into exile.\n\nNew elections were held in 1951 that gave the MNR a plurality, leading the military to nullify the elections. The FSTMB and POR formed militias of workers that fought on the side of the MNR. These militias fought government forces and stormed army bases. These struggles culminated in the \"Bolivian National Revolution\" in April 1952, which placed the MNR in control of the government. Following the revolution, the FSTMB became the main component of the Bolivian Workers' Center (COB), a new umbrella organization for all labor unions. Most of the large-scale tin mines were nationalized and placed under the control of a new government agency, the Corporaci\u00f3n Minera de Bolivia (COMIBOL). COMIBOL was managed jointly by the government and the FSTMB.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1982, a series of military dictators ruled Bolivia. The FSTMB and the COB often faced harsh government repression, most notably under the regimes of Colonel Hugo Banzer (1971\u201378) and General Luis Garc\u00eda Meza (1980\u201381). Many of the union's leaders were jailed or forced into exile during these years. The FSTMB became a leading force in Bolivian politics once again with the restoration of democracy in 1982.\n\nIn 1985 the world tin market crashed. The MNR-led government of V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro conceded to an economic restructuring plan set forward by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. As part of the plan, the government closed or privatized most of the state-controlled tin mines. Between 1985 to 1987, the workforce of the state mining company fell from 30,000 to just 7,000. This devastated the membership of the FSTMB. Many retired mining workers remained active in political life, including as members of the Mining Pensioners' Association (Asociaci\u00f3n de Rentistas Mineras).\n\nDespite its setbacks, the FSTMB remained active in the labor movement and politics. The union was at the forefront of the  movement against water privatization in 2000, and has campaigned for nationalization of Bolivia's natural gas reserves. The FSTMB was also involved in the protests that brought the resignations of President Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada in 2003 and President Carlos Mesa in June 2005. They have also pressured the government to re-nationalize the country's mines.\n\nThe current Executive Secretary of the FSTMB is Miguel Zubieta Miranda, who previously led the union's local in Huanuni.", "title": "Federaci\u00f3n Sindical de Trabajadores Mineros de Bolivia"}

The company attempted to make the mining operation as self-sufficient as possible, by building a dedicated port, power station, power grid and water supply system. They also built housing, medical and recreational facilities for their workers. In 1995 the company abandoned their operation because of the Sierra Leone Civil War.\n\nIn January 2005, the company agreed a mining lease covering 580\u00a0km\u00b2 of South West Sierra Leone, about 150\u00a0km South East of the capital.\n\nOn 28 February 2005, the company announced that they were beginning refurbishment of the Sierra Rutile Mine, to be completed in early 2006.

It was first called the Alpha group of claims in the 1920s, when underground miners were exploring the seams of Cadwallader Creek and the origins of the placer deposits downstream in the Bridge River. The mine prospect was never much successful although a model townsite was built by promoter \"Big Bill\" Davidson, who imported soil to build a specially-built rodeo ground and baseball diamond on the rocky site.  The larger mine of Bralorne was nearby.  The mine shut down in 1936 due to productivity issues, but restarted in 1940. The valley has since been significantly altered when most of the vestiges of the town were inundated by the waters of the Carpenter Lake reservoir following completion of the Bridge River Power Project.  The town sat on the western end of the lake near the present Carpenter Lake Road (a section of BC Road 40), part of the road drove through a wooden Tudor arch built into the rock mill.

{"text": "The Connellsville Coalfield is located in Fayette County and Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, between the city of Latrobe and the small borough of Smithfield, and is sometimes known as the Connellsville Coke Field.  This is because the section of the Pittsburgh coal seam here was famous as one of the finest metallurgical coals in the world.  It is locally known as the Connellsville coal seam, but is actually a portion of the Pittsburgh seam.  \nCoal was mined in this field from the early 19th century.  Actual coking of the coal was first tried near Connellsville in the 1840s.  After the Civil War a beehive coke industry gained a foothold in the region.  The heyday of the Connellsville Coalfield was from the 1880s to the 1920s.  At least 60 coal towns, known as \"coal patches\", were constructed in the field.  H.C. Frick Coal and Coke - a subsidiary of U.S. Steel after 1903 - was the major player.  Other notable industrialists included Josiah Van Kirk Thompson, W. J. Rainey, and Philip Cochran.  \n\nIn an event known as the Morewood massacre in the early morning of April 2, 1891, local law enforcement shot into a crowd of striking United Mine Workers miners from the Morewood Coke Works, near Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania.  Seven miners died on the scene, and three more later died from their injuries.  http://patheoldminer.rootsweb.ancestry.com/morewood2.html\n\nThe coalfield endured the long decline in the beehive coke industry and a gradual exhaustion of the coal reserves.

Established in 1849, Mintaro is situated on land which was bought originally by Joseph and Henry Gilbert, which they sub-divided into 80 allotments.\n\nMintaro was originally intended as a stopping and resting place for the bullock teams carting copper ore from the Burra mine to Port Wakefield. By 1876 the population was recorded as 400. Mintaro continued to develop as a rural service centre during the 1870s and early 1880s, when pastoral and agricultural activities boomed in the state's mid north. After 1930, there was a general decline in rural populations and little development took place within the town for several decades.\n\nThe Mintaro district includes prominent Martindale Hall and Kadlunga, two large pastoral properties. Known for its high quality, Mintaro slate is produced from what is believed to be the oldest continuing operating quarry in Australia. Although Mintaro is primarily an agricultural community, tourism plays an increasingly important role.

The tower consists of a wooden wall-like frame stuffed with bundles of brushwood (typically blackthorn) which have to be changed about every 5 to 10 years as they become encrusted with mineral deposits over time. The salt water runs down the tower and partly evaporates; at the same time some minerals from the solution are left behind on the brushwood twigs.\n\nGraduation towers can be found in a number of spa towns, primarily in Germany but also Poland and Austria.

{"text": "The existence of a slate industry in Wales is attested since the Roman period, when slate was used to roof the fort at Segontium, now Caernarfon. The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century, then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century, at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest Wales, including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda, the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis, the Nantlle Valley quarries, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, where the slate was mined rather than quarried. Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world, and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world.Jones p. 72 Slate is mainly used for roofing, but is also produced as thicker slab for a variety of uses including flooring, worktops and headstones.Lindsay p. 133\n\nUp to the end of the 18th century, slate was extracted on a small scale by groups of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports.\n\nThe slate industry  dominated the economy of north-west Wales during the second half of the 19th century, but was on a much smaller scale elsewhere. In 1898, a work force of 17,000 men produced half a million tons of slate. A bitter industrial dispute at the Penrhyn Quarry between 1900 and 1903 marked the beginning of its decline, and the First World War saw a great reduction in the number of men employed in the industry. The Great Depression and Second World War led to the closure of many smaller quarries, and competition from other roofing materials, particularly tiles, resulted in the closure of most of the larger quarries in the 1960s and 1970s. Slate production continues on a much reduced scale.\n\nThe slate industry in North Wales is on the tentative World Heritage Site list whilst Welsh slate has been designated by the International Union of Geological Sciences as a Global Heritage Stone Resource.", "title": "Slate industry in Wales"}

{"text": "The Rock Springs massacre, also known as the Rock Springs Riot, occurred on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, and resulting massacre of immigrant Chinese miners by white immigrant miners, was the result of racial prejudice toward the Chinese miners, who were perceived to be taking jobs from the white miners. The Union Pacific Coal Department found it economically beneficial to give preference in hiring to Chinese miners, who were willing to work for lower wages than their white counterparts, angering the white miners. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes, resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).\n\nTension between whites and Chinese immigrants in the late 19th century American West was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was one among several instances of violence culminating from years of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to Wyoming Territory took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment on the part of whites. The Knights of Labor, one of the foremost voices against Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the riot, federal troops were deployed in Rock Springs. They escorted the surviving Chinese miners, most of whom had fled to Evanston, Wyoming, back to Rock Springs a week after the riot. Reaction came swiftly from the era's publications. In Rock Springs, the local newspaper endorsed the outcome of the riot, while in other Wyoming newspapers, support for the riot was limited to sympathy for the causes of the white miners. The massacre in Rock Springs touched off a wave of anti-Chinese violence, especially in the Puget Sound area of Washington Territory.", "title": "Rock Springs massacre"}

In 1871, Idestam and Leo Mechelin founded Nokia Ltd. and moved the company's operations to the city of Nokia, Finland.\n\nHe was buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki.", "title": "Fredrik Idestam"}
{"text": "A triaxial shear test is a common method to measure the mechanical properties of many deformable solids, especially soil (e.g., sand, clay) and rock, and other granular materials or powders. There are several variations on the test.\nIn a triaxial shear test, stress is applied to a sample of the material being tested in a way which results in stresses along one axis being different from the stresses in perpendicular directions. This is typically achieved by placing the sample between two parallel platens which apply stress in one (usually vertical) direction, and applying fluid pressure to the specimen to apply stress in the perpendicular directions. (Testing apparatus which allows application of different levels of stress in each of three orthogonal directions are discussed below, under \"True Triaxial test\".)\n\n\nThe application of different compressive stresses in the test apparatus causes shear stress to develop in the sample; the loads can be increased and deflections monitored until failure of the sample. During the test, the surrounding fluid is pressurized, and the stress on the platens is increased until the material in the cylinder fails and forms sliding regions within itself, known as shear bands. The geometry of the shearing in a triaxial test typically causes the sample to become shorter while bulging out along the sides. The stress on the platen is then reduced and the water pressure pushes the sides back in, causing the sample to grow taller again. This cycle is usually repeated several times while collecting stress and strain data about the sample. During the test the pore pressures of fluids (e.g., water, oil) or gasses in the sample may be measured using Bishop's pore pressure apparatus.\n\nFrom the triaxial test data, it is possible to extract fundamental material parameters about the sample, including its angle of shearing resistance, apparent cohesion, and dilatancy angle. These parameters are then used in computer models to predict how the material will behave in a larger-scale engineering application. An example would be to predict the stability of the soil on a slope, whether the slope will collapse or whether the soil will support the shear stresses of the slope and remain in place. Triaxial tests are used along with other tests to make such engineering predictions.\n\nDuring the shearing, a granular material will typically have a net gain or loss of volume. If it had originally been in a dense state, then it typically gains volume, a characteristic known as Reynolds' dilatancy. If it had originally been in a very loose state, then contraction may occur before the shearing begins or in conjunction with the shearing.\n\nSometimes, testing of cohesive samples is done with no confining pressure, in an unconfined compression test. This requires much simpler and less expensive apparatus and sample preparation, though the applicability is limited to samples that the sides won't crumble when exposed, and the confining stress being lower than the in-situ stress gives results which may be overly conservative. The compression test performed for concrete strength testing is essentially the same test, on apparatus designed for the larger samples and higher loads typical of concrete testing.", "title": "Triaxial shear test"}

{"text": "Goldboro  is a Canadian rural community in Guysborough County, Nova Scotia.\n\nLocated on the Eastern Shore along Route 316, Goldboro is approximately 16 kilometres west of the shire town of Guysborough.\n\nIn 1861 gold was discovered in quartz veins on the Isaac's Harbour anticline to the east of the community. Al together 14 mines were developed in this area producing some 140,000 ounces of reported production. Production ceased in 1941 with the closure of the Lower Seal Harbour Mine.\n\nIn 1892, Howard Richardson was the first to note gold within shale and quartz veins which became generally known as the Boston Richardson Belt. Mining on the property began in 1892 when the Richardson Gold Mining Company started developing the belt and continued until 1912.\n\nIn 1985 exploration re-commenced on the Upper Seal Harbour gold district and in 1988 extensive surface and underground work was carried out by Orex Exploration. The property has seen several developers look at it from an open pit potential, but all to date have dropped their options. At present Anaconda Mining is conducting an extensive exploration program for gold in the surrounding areas including the former Boston Richardson Mine, Dolliver Mountain Mine, West Goldbrook Mine and East Goldbrook Mines. Plans are to develop an 800 TPD open pit and underground operation producing around 41,000 ounces per year.\n\nDuring the late 1990s, Goldboro was selected as the eastern terminus for the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline which connects to the Sable Offshore Energy Project (SOEI) gas plant.  Goldboro has been marketed as the energy hub of Nova Scotia. The Sable project is now facing end of life closing, as is the Encana Deep Panuke project. The Sable proponents have commenced decommissioning activities of the offshore facilities and will cease production some time in 2019.\n\nIn 2012 Pieridae Energy announced it planned to develop a two train 10 million ton per annum LNG plant and associated facilities. The pre-development work is complete and a final investment decision expected by the end of 2018 or early 2019 with production by 2022.", "title": "Goldboro, Nova Scotia"}

{"text": "The Devil's Miner is a 2005 documentary film directed by independent film directors Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani. The film follows a fourteen-year-old Bolivian boy named Basilio Vargas who along with his twelve-year-old brother Bernardino work in the mines near the city of Potos\u00ed. The film includes many subtle realities of the miner's lives such as the need to chew coca leaves to numb the pain of hunger and the long shifts they work regardless of age.http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The-Devil-s-Miner/70043419 The film made its world premier at the Rotterdam film festival and its U.S. debut at the Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nThe film concentrates on the concerns of local workers who have fear of what they call \u201cTio\u201d or devil. In the film, an elder miner claims that over 8 million people have died in the unsafe mines. The workers believe this is because \u201cTio\u201d controls the mine and that Christ has no power in the mine. The workers often give offerings such as coca leaves, alcohol, cigarettes and perform sacrifices, such as slaughtering a llama and applying its blood to the mine entrance to appease a makeshift statue of \"Tio\". Each mine has its own Tio which all of the workers pray to upon entering so that they may find a good vein of silver and so that they may be granted protection from explosions, toxic gas, silicosis, and falling rocks.The local Catholic priest is unable to tame these fears of \u201cTio\u201d although the workers often pray at the church before entering the mine,upon observing the miners attending Mass, the local priest said that when he looked into the face of the miners he \"saw Christ dying\". The irony which is upon these people is one of great sorrow. They worship both God and the Devil, Light and Dark, The God of the world, and the god of the earthen mine below. \n\nAs of 2014, Basilio is studying tourism, working in the mines three nights a week, and working as a tour guide in the mines. Bernardino, now married, still works in the mines full-time whilst studying in the evenings. The boys no longer live on the mountain, however their mother remains in the same house.https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/devilsminer/update.html", "title": "The Devil's Miner"}

{"text": "Sundew was a large electrically powered dragline excavator used in mining operations in Rutland and Northamptonshire in the United Kingdom.\n\nBuilt by Ransomes & Rapier and named after the winning horse of the 1957 Grand National, it began work in a Rutland iron ore quarry belonging to the United Steel Companies (Ore Mining Branch) that year.  At the time of its construction Sundew was the largest walking dragline in the world, weighing .  With a reach of  and a bucket capacity of  the machine was able to move a substantial amount of material in a relatively short period.\n\nPropulsion was via two large movable feet which could be used to \"walk\" the dragline forwards and backwards, while directional control was provided by a large circular turntable under the body of the machine.\n\nSundew remained until operations at the quarry ceased in 1974 and plans were then devised to relocate the machine to a recently opened British Steel Corporation quarry near Corby.  At a cost of \u00a3250,000 and taking two years to complete, it was decided that dismantling, moving and reconstructing the machine was not a viable option, and so over an eight-week period in 1974 Sundew walked  from its home in Exton Park near the village of Exton in Rutland to a site north of Corby.  During the walk the dragline crossed three water mains, four water courses, 13 power lines, ten roads, a railway line, two gas mains, seven telephone lines, 74 hedges, and the River Welland before reaching its new home. \n\nAs part of a major restructuring of British Steel in the late 1970s Corby Steelworks was closed down, and there was no longer any need for a large dragline to assist in the recovery of iron ore. On 4 July 1980 Sundew walked to its final resting place and the huge boom was lowered onto a purpose-built earth mound. There it remained for seven years until being scrapped over a six-month period from January to June 1987.

Malmsbury is in the north western area of the Shire of Macedon Ranges local government area.\n\nThe original inhabitants of the local area were the Dja Dja Wurrung people.  European settlement began with squatters raising sheep and cattle.  Gold was discovered in 1858 and the town became a service centre for diggers travelling to Bendigo and Castlemaine. Malmesbury  Post Office opened on 9 November 1854, closed within two months, reopened in 1856, and was renamed Malmsbury around 1896, although the name Malmesbury remains in occasional use.\n\nEdward Davy, who invented the electric relay, making long-distance telegraphy possible, was mayor of Malmsbury three times in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nThe Malmsbury area is known for its deposits of bluestone, used in the construction of notable buildings both locally and throughout the state. The town also houses the Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre, a custodial centre for young adult males aged 18\u201321 deemed too vulnerable for adult prison. On 25 January 2017, there was a riot at the Youth Justice Centre which involved 30 inmates, 15 of these inmates escaped the premises. 8 of these escapees were arrested shortly after however, the other 7 fled the area in stolen cars. Witnesses reported vehicles travelling at high speed through the Castlemaine area and footage was recorded of offenders stealing petrol from a service station.\n\nMalmsbury has a railway station on the Melbourne to Bendigo railway line. The Malmsbury Viaduct  River is a large masonry arch rail bridge constructed over the Coliban River in 1859 and is classified \"A\" by the National Trust. The town's school uses the viaduct as its emblem. A stretch of the Calder Freeway (M79) bypassing Malmsbury was officially opened on 12 April 2008, and the removal of heavy through traffic was celebrated eight days later by the holding of a \"Monster Street Party\" in the town.\n\nSince the Calder Freeway bypass construction, Malmsbury has gained a reputation as a getaway destination for tourists across the country. During this period several restaurants have opened up in the town such as Small Holdings, The Moto Bean Cafe and the resurgent Mill once again under new ownership. Each of these new destinations complements the older establishments such as the Malmsbury Bakery.", "title": "Malmsbury, Victoria"}

{"text": "Burlington Slate Quarries are located near Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, England. The quarries have produced a characteristic blue-grey slate for hundreds of years, with large-scale production starting in the early 19th century, when the Cavendish family organised small-scale quarrying activities by local farmers into a larger group of quarries, which then attracted others into the area to live and work in the quarries from the 1820s onwards. \nThe slates were formed during the Early Devonian when a slaty cleavage was imposed on the Ordovician and Silurian rocks of the area. The best quality slate with the most even and regular cleavage was formed from\nthe lithologically uniform mudstone successions.\n\nThe quarrying at Burlington can be directly related to the development of Kirkby, which merged from six smaller farming hamlets: Soutergate, Wall End, Beck Side, Sand Side, Marshside and Chapels. The opening of the slate quarry helped merge these, the name Kirkby dating from the construction of the Cumbrian Coast railway line to the village. \n\nThe quarry does not have a galleries system, as many quarries are, but as an enormous pit several hundred feet in depth. The quarry operations have spread throughout and under Kirkby Moor, but now production only takes place at the very bottom of the quarry; with the rock being removed via a cutting from a shallower part of the pit.\n\nThe slate blocks were initially removed from the large open pits by blasting and then reduced to a manageable size using a mell (sledge hammer) and tully (long-handled wedge-shaped hammer) before being transported to the cutting sheds, sawn to size and riven into thin slates. Typical of many Welsh slate quarries, such as Dinorwig, Penrhyn and Rhiw-Bach, Burlington adopted the use of a long series of inclined trackways and water balance lifts to provide material transport from the quarries. The lowest of the series was the Sandside, which connected Burlington with the port and mainline railway at Sandside on the Duddon Estuary.", "title": "Burlington Slate Quarries"}

{"text": "Nonel is a shock tube detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally for the purpose of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500\u00a0ft/s (2,000\u00a0m/s) along the length of the tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of nonel detonators incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications.\nNonel was invented by the Swedish company Nitro Nobel in the 1960s and 1970s,http://www.dynonobel.com/ under the leadership of Per-Anders Persson,New York Times, 1990-03-05 and launched to the demolitions market in 1973.http://www.ausimm.com/presentations/podoliak.pdf (Nitro Nobel became a part of Dyno Nobel after being sold to Norwegian Dyno Industrier AS in 1986.)

{"text": "The Sutro Tunnel is a drainage tunnel (adit) connected to the Comstock Lode in Northern Nevada. It begins at Virginia City, Nevada and empties approximately 6 miles southeast near the town of Dayton, Nevada.\n\nThe tunnel was proposed by Adolph Sutro in 1860. He promoted the drainage tunnel to allow access to deeper mineral exploration in the Comstock. Flooding and inadequate pumps had inhibited some exploration until that time.\n\nBy 1865, Sutro's idea had gained the approval of state and federal legislation. The mining interests of the Comstock initially supported the project, but later opposed the idea. They feared that an alternate access point to the Comstock minerals would threaten their monopoly on the mining and milling of gold and silver in the Comstock.\n\nNonetheless, Sutro formed the Sutro Tunnel Company, selling stock certificates to raise funds for its construction, which began in 1869. Financing also came from local miners motivated by the prospect of improved mine safety. This motivation was further advocated (perhaps exploited) by Sutro after the Yellowjacket mine disaster where dozens of miners were burned to death because they could not escape.\n\nArthur De Wint Foote worked on the tunnel in 1873, but was fired in 1874, having struck a flood of water in Shaft No. 2.\n\nThe main tunnel was completed in 1878.  By then the Comstock mine had gone deeper, using improved pumps, and was also thinning out. Lateral tunnels were created to enhance drainage and ventilation. Upon completion, Adolph Sutro immediately sold his interest in the tunnel company and moved to San Francisco, later becoming mayor, building the Sutro Baths and a small Sutro Tunnel to them.\n\nThe Sutro Tunnel pioneered the excavation of large drainage and access tunnels in the US.

{"text": "The Rudd Concession, a written concession for exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and other adjoining territories in what is today Zimbabwe, was granted by King Lobengula of Matabeleland to Charles Rudd, James Rochfort Maguire and Francis Thompson, three agents acting on behalf of the South African-based politician and businessman Cecil Rhodes, on 30 October 1888. Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to disavow it, it proved the foundation for the royal charter granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's British South Africa Company in October 1889, and thereafter for the Pioneer Column's occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, administration and development in the country that eventually became Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, in 1895.\n\nRhodes's pursuit of the exclusive mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire as part of his personal ambition for a Cape to Cairo Railway\u2014winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi\u2013Limpopo watershed on Britain's behalf. He laid the groundwork for concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna (tribal leaders).\n\nThe concession conferred on the grantees the sole rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, as well as the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.\n\nAfter Rhodes and the London consortium agreed to pool their interests, Rhodes travelled to London, arriving in March 1889. His amalgamated charter bid gathered great political and popular support over the next few months, prompting the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, to approve the royal charter, which was formally granted in October 1889. The Company occupied and annexed Mashonaland about a year later. Attempting to set up a rival to the Rudd Concession, Lobengula granted similar rights to the German businessman Eduard Lippert in 1891, but Rhodes promptly acquired this concession as well.

The water tanks, built between 1912 and 1918, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places because they represent the historical period of community planning, public works, and engineering that supported the development of the Cuyuna Range.  Their construction was made possible by a favorable property tax arrangement on the iron mines that brought significant revenues to the towns of Crosby, Cuyuna, Deerwood, Ironton, and Trommald.  The communities began around 1910, when iron mining started on the Range.  The peak of mining employment was around 1920, and it started to decline around 1930.  By the 1950s, iron mining was well in decline on the Cuyuna Range.\n\nState historian Theodore C. Blegen wrote, \nA singular aspect of range-town life was the blossoming of schools, community buildings, parks, splendid streets, and other public improvements built generously, not to say lavishly.  They set standards far beyond those of most Minnesota cities at the time.  These reflected at once a public desire for the best, a concern on the part of citizens for the education of their children, and the availability of taxes to provide the funds without stint for public wants. \nEven the smaller communities were able to install complete water systems.  After the end of iron mining, as the communities lost population, many of the publicly funded improvements such as schools have disappeared, and many of the houses have either been torn down or were left abandoned and dilapidated.  Within Trommald and Cuyuna, the water towers are the most visible remains of the mining boom years.", "title": "Cuyuna Iron Range Municipally-Owned Elevated Metal Water Tanks"}

{"text": "The Stannary Palace, also known as the Duchy Palace, circa 1265\u20131300, was a complex of buildings constructed by the Earls of Cornwall as the centre of their administration. The surviving exchequer hall is reputed to be the oldest non-ecclesiastical building in Cornwall. The much larger great hall, of which large parts remain, was built as a replica of Westminster Hall. Its original function was as a Court and place of taxation dealing with the Cornish tin industry. The Earls of Cornwall and later, after 1337, the Dukes of Cornwall had their residence at Restormel Castle so the original name would have been the Stannary Hall or the Great Hall of Lostwithiel. After 1337 it was sometimes referred to as the Duchy Palace.\n\nIn 1265 Richard, Earl of Cornwall, second son of King John and brother of King Henry III, acquired Restormel Castle, the Borough of Lostwithiel and the town of Fowey, from the de Cardinan family. During this period Lostwithiel was the most important port of Cornwall and second only to Southampton along the South Coast. In 1273 Richard died and was succeeded by his son Edmund, who took occupation of Restormel Castle and built the Great Hall.\n\nThis building was a very large complex, covering more than  and consisted of the Great Hall, which was the Convocation Hall for the Stannaries and Duchy affairs. It also housed the Smelting Houses, the Coinage Hall for the Stannaries and Duchy. In this complex the Stannary Courts were held and the Stannary prison. Records state that the whole complex was built and completed between 1272 and 1300 and regarded as the finest and grandest buildings in Cornwall.\n\nIn 1338 the Earldom was raised to a Dukedom and the first Duke was the Edward, the Black Prince. The building then became the administration centre for the Duchy and the only polling station for the whole of Cornwall.\n\nThe Cornish Stannaries were suspended as a consequence of the Cornish Rebellion of 1497.Timeline of Cornish History 1966 -1700 AD, (Cornwall County Council)  Henry VII restored them in return for a payment from the tin miners of the, at the time, enormous sum of \u00a31000, to support his war on Scotland. In addition to restoring the Stannaries and pardoning the people who participated in the rebellion, Henry's Charter of Pardon of 1508 provided that no new laws affecting miners should be enacted without the consent of twenty-four stannators, six being chosen from each of the four stannaries at Lostwithiel, Launceston, Truro and Helston.\n\nThe 1508 Charter states, \"No [Westminster] Act or Statute shall have effect in the Stannaries without the assent and consent of the twenty-four stannators.\" Acting in its capacity as appeal court for the colonies, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has declared that any reference to The Stannaries means the whole of Cornwall.\n\nAlthough England had its own London based Exchequer, the unabridged Charter of Pardon makes no less than ten separate references to the Lostwithiel exchequer; thus illustrating one aspect of the constitutional linkage between Stannary and Duchy.\n\nIn September 1644 AD, the English Civil War was at its height and the town of Lostwithiel was taken by the Earl of Essex who made it his headquarters. During the battle the town was badly damaged, the Great Hall sacked and burnt, destroying valuable records of the Shire and Stannaries. The part known as the Exchequer Hall was the least damaged and this then became the Convocation Hall for the Stannaries and the Public Convocation.\n\nIn 1533, John Leland stated that \u201cin Lostwithiel is the Shire Hall for Cornwall and it is the Shire town for Cornwall.\u201d In 1585 John Norden, in his survey, stated the same. In 1495 Henry VII instructed Parliament to pass an Act that the Weights and Measures for Cornwall be placed at Lostwithiel and these weights are now part of the Old Borough Regalia.\n\nThe last Tinners Parliament was held in the Hall in 1751 and in 1874 the Duchy Offices were removed elsewhere. The whole building was sold to tradesmen of the town. The Convocation Hall became a Drill Hall. This is now owned by the Freemasons. Within the building in the upper ante room, traces remain of a Medieval Rose window which was over the original South entrance. Original oak supports and timbers still exist.\n\nAt the north end of the building is the Duchy Coat of Arms of the 15 bezants, circa 1650, and it is said to be the earliest Arms of the Duchy in this formation anywhere. On the apex of the Hall roof is the Prince of Wales\u2019 plume of feathers which was probably erected by the Black Prince when he paid his first visit to Lostwithiel and Restormel Castle in 1353. Today the buildings are used as dwellings, antique shop and printers. \n\nThe Duchy Palace (the building at the north end of the complex) was used as a Masonic Hall until it was purchased by the Prince's Regeneration Trust in late 2008. The Trust has begun repairs, in consultation with the Cornwall Building Preservation Trust. Current tenants are Lostwithiel Town Band while other potential uses for the building are investigated.", "title": "Lostwithiel Stannary Palace"}

A hotbed for mining in the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Burke Canyon now contains several ghost towns and remnants of former communities along Idaho State Highway 4, which runs northeast through the narrow canyon to the Montana border.\n\nBurke Canyon takes its name from the town of Burke; settlers arrived in the canyon in 1884 after silver, lead, and zinc were found in mines throughout. Between 1886 and 1890, numerous mining communities developed in the canyon. Many of the communities in Burke Canyon saw multiple labor disputes, namely the Coeur d'Alene labor strike of 1892 and the confrontation of 1899, which resulted in violent conflict between miners and mine owners.\n\nPopulations throughout the canyon's towns dwindled in the late-twentieth century after a series of natural disasters and mine closures, and the last active mine in the canyon was closed in 1991, leaving the majority of the communities unpopulated.

{"text": "Mount Waldo is a small mountain about  high in Waldo County, Maine. It is located in the town of Frankfort.\n\nMt. Waldo granite was once the stock in trade of a thriving industry. The Mount Waldo Granite has a coarse-grained texture which gives it a more patchy, mottled look than the finer-grained granites.  Although granite is no longer quarried here, it can still be seen in buildings in many eastern cities, such as New York, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.\n\nThe combination of bare rock ledges and proximity to tidewater made this granite amenable to quarrying in the early 19th century. The two significant quarries in the Mount Waldo Granite in the 19th century were on the northeast flank of Mount Waldo itself, and near the top of Mosquito Mountain. According to a description of the operations from the early 20th century, the quarried stone was taken over graded tracks, operated by gravity, to cutting sheds and wharfs on Marsh River. From there it was taken on the Penobscot River and distributed to eastern ports in Massachusetts, New York, and Philadelphia, and to \"western\" cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, and Cleveland.Dale, T. Nelson, 1907, The granites of Maine: U. S. Geological Survey, Bulletin 313, pg. 202  The granite from Mt.

The operator of the quarry was the Mount Waldo Granite Works of Frankfort.  Granite from the quarry was reportedly a medium gray color.  Transport of the granite was by two graded tracks, each  long, operated by gravity from the quarry part way down the hill to the power house, thence by a cable road (Roebling engine) 1\u00bc miles to the wharf, which is accessible to schooners at  draft.

{"text": "The Luxulyan Valley (, meaning alder tree valley) is the steep sided and thickly wooded valley of the River Par, situated in mid  Cornwall, England, UK. It contains a major concentration of early 19th century industrial remains, and was designated as part of a World Heritage Site in 2006.\n\nThe valley stretches south-east from the village of Luxulyan . It reaches as far as the edge of the built-up area around the town of St Blazey and the port of Par, a distance of some 5\u00a0km. It lies within the civil parishes of Luxulyan, Lanlivery and Tywardreath, and is one of the areas (designated A8i in the original nomination) of the larger, but discontinuous, Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site.Ordnance Survey (2005). OS Explorer Map 107 - St Austell & Liskeard: Fowey, Looe & Lostwithiel. .\n\nMost of the industrial remains in the valley are the results of the endeavours of Joseph Treffry (1782\u20131850). Copper mining was booming in the area during the early 19th century, and Treffry was the owner of Fowey Consols mine, one of the deepest, richest and most important of the Cornish copper mines. The mine was situated to the east of the southern end of the Luxulyan Valley proper, and its site is part of the designated World Heritage Site. At its peak it was worked by six steam engines and 17 water wheels.\n\nIn the late 1820s, Treffry built the port of Par Harbour. He then linked this to Pontsmill, at the southern end of the valley, by means of the Par Canal. A mineral tramway connected the canal head to the mine. A second tramway followed in 1835, via an inclined plane, a flat route along the eastern lip of the valley, and the major Treffry Viaduct across the valley to Luxulyan. This second route served two major purposes, as it enabled Treffry to develop Carbeans and Colcerrow granite quarries in the upper valley, and was also used by a leat carrying water to supply the mine at Fowey Consols. Two further granite quarries, known as Rock Mill and Orchard, operated lower down in the valley. In 1870 these were linked to Pontsmill by a third tramway along the valley floor.\n\nThe 1835 tramway eventually became part of the Cornwall Minerals Railway which linked the English Channel ports of Par and Fowey with the china clay workings of mid Cornwall, and to the Atlantic port of Newquay. As part of this process, the section of the route between Pontsmill and Luxulyan, with its incline and flat sections ideal for animal haulage, was replaced with a more gradually climbing route through the valley itself, more suited to locomotive haulage. The newer route is still in use, as part of the Atlantic Coast Line, and passes beneath the spans of the Treffry Viaduct that carried its predecessor. The older tramway routes remained in use to serve the various granite quarries until the early 20th century. The last stone came from Carbeans in 1933 but a few sections of Treffry's rails can still be found.\n\nThe thickly-wooded terrain of the Luxulyan Valley also played a major part in the early tin mining industry of Cornwall. The woods were important for making the charcoal that was needed in large quantities for smelting tin from the rich alluvial deposits on the moors to the northwest. Charcoal-burning platforms are to be found close to nearby Prideaux Castle.", "title": "Luxulyan Valley"}

It was home for approximately 1,200 people, many of whom were skilled immigrants from Scotland. After managing for ten years using bullock teams for transport, a railway was allowed and was connected to the nearby town of Mittagong by a narrow gauge railway that terminated adjacent to the main Southern Railway line in Mittagong. The town existed to mine oil shale from which kerosene was extracted by the Australian Kerosene Oil and Mineral Co. The process was superseded by conventional kerosene production from oil and the oil shale mining became uneconomical. By 1911, the town had become deserted as inhabitants relocated in search of work. The property was auctioned off that year to a private buyer. The fruit orchard, which included 6,700 trees continued to operate until 1924, exporting fruit for local and interstate consumption.\n\nSituated in a deep valley, the town had limited access by road, instead exporting shale via a steep railway (incline) out of the valley.

{"text": "Ninja miner is a nickname for a person who digs small unauthorized mines or pans dirt for gold in Mongolia. The miners are so named because the green bowls they use for panning, when carried on their backs, are said to resemble the shells of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Channel 4 UK TV program \"Unreported World\", 7.30 to 8.00 pm, Friday 15 June 2007\n\nMany ninja miners are Mongolians who lost their jobs after the fall of the People's Republic of Mongolia and became traditional herders. In 2001 and 2002 Mongolia faced two harsh winters (known as dzuds), and a third of the country's livestock was lost. Thousands of families took up ninja mining, and searched for quartz or gold on properties large mining companies deemed unmineable. The ninja mining process starts by a group of miners (up to four) digging a hole usually  deep using iron stakes, or until reaching a depth with a high gold content. Holes that are near to each other are connected underground. Upon completion of the hole one ninja miner works at the bottom of the hole by candlelight, digging up dirt, while another pulls dirt to the surface to be sifted by yet another ninja miner.\n\nIn 2003 there were approximately 30,000 ninja miners in Mongolia, which increased to 100,000 in 2007. Ninja miners earned an average of $10 a week in 2003, which increased to $5\u201310 per day in 2007. Students on summer break often work with their parents to help pay tuition. The largest ninja mining area is at Zaamar, a five-hour drive from Ulan Bator.\n\nNinja Mining is having an adverse effect on agriculture, as nomadic herders are having to move more frequently to find land for their livestock to graze on due to the increase in holes and the reduced amount of grass. This combined with the northward expansion of the Gobi Desert is causing some herders to reduce their herd to focus on higher quality livestock, while others are giving up nomadism and moving setting up farms and cooperatives. Peter Morrow, the CEO of Khan Bank (the former state agricultural bank) said this could be the end of traditional herding in Mongolia, \"the last horse-based nomadic culture in the world\".\n\nAn episode of the Animal Planet series River Monsters filmed in Mongolia mentioned ninja miners; a local guide mentioning that ninjas will aggressively defend their claims from intruders.\n\nA feature-documentary Price of Gold  (Sven Zellner, Chingunjav Borkhuu; D 2012) ARTE - Dokumentarfilmpreis Duisburger Filmwoche  - HotDocs Toronto 2012, official selection World Showcase.\n\nA photo-essay \"Ninjas\" by Sven Zellner and Building Sand Castles on the Steppe?

{"text": "Carpenter is a ghost town in Mesa County, Colorado, United States, twelve miles northeast of Grand Junction at the end of an extension to 27\u00bc Road. The settlement was established by William Thomas Carpenter early in 1890 to provide the miners who worked in his two Book Cliff mines with a place to live. He began building shacks to house his single miners and later erected small houses for the employees with families. As a result of the town's rapid growth, a request to the U.S. post office to establish a branch there in June 1890 was quickly obliged and the community was officially dubbed Carpenter. However, the town never attained a population of over 50, and the post office closed its doors after only a year. After the closure of its post office, Carpenter built a company store and a combination boarding house/restaurant. Book Cliff company stone cutters and masons constructed several buildings and many foundations at Carpenter, using stone from the company quarry near the cliffs. One of the finest examples of a building made of Book Cliff sandstone is the Fruita, Colorado Catholic church. Several years of prosperity followed the arrival of the Little Book Cliff Railway at the townsite in 1892. Carpenter began to formulate big plans for his village. He envisioned it as a tourist resort complete with hotel, dance pavilion, picnic areas, and even a lake that was to be fed by a spring located near his Book Cliff mines. Carpenter renamed the camp Poland Spring after a noted resort of that name in Maine. It was variously referred to as Polen, Pollen, and Polan Springs, despite the fact that Carpenter\u2019s intended name was evidenced by his having it emblazoned on the side of one of his railroad excursion cars. The resort plans were never completed because Carpenter went broke shortly after the Panic of 1893. Isaac Chauncey Wyman, a wealthy Massachusetts investor, became the next owner of the Book Cliff company. The town continued to enjoy an active existence because he did much to improve the mines and thus created a need for additional employees. The old eating house, referred to as the Hotel de Carpenter on occasion, was converted into a school and church for the camp\u2019s inhabitants, and many company structures were rebuilt and improved during Wyman\u2019s tenure as owner. The new name Book Cliff was applied to the town but did not adhere any better than did Poland Springs.

In situ leach works by artificially dissolving minerals occurring naturally in a solid state. For recovery of material occurring naturally in solution, see: Brine mining.\n\nThe process initially involves the drilling of holes into the ore deposit. Explosive or hydraulic fracturing may be used to create open pathways in the deposit for solution to penetrate. Leaching solution is pumped into the deposit where it makes contact with the ore. The solution bearing the dissolved ore content is then pumped to the surface and processed.  This process allows the extraction of metals and salts from an ore body without the need for conventional mining involving drill-and-blast, open-cut or underground mining.", "title": "In situ leach"}

Using his investments in the Kimberley diamond fields, particularly his 25% share in De Beers, Barnato foresaw the value of and invested in the potential of the Witwatersrand gold mines. At first he bought small but rich mines near Germiston \u2013 the New Primrose, named after his daughter, and others in the same region. \n\nIn 1913 JCI bought the Randfontein Estates Gold Mining Company, which was a fabulously rich mine, from Sir J.B. Robinson. At the peak of its production Randfontein was equipped with 600 stamp mills, the roar of which could be heard in Johannesburg. Randfontein Estates was an extraordinarily rich mining property, and in the 1950s was a pioneer of uranium production. During the 1930s Randfontein was the largest gold producer in South Africa, if not the world.\n\nJCI was also involved with numerous mining ventures \u2013 New State Mines at Brakpan, Modder Deep Mines at Benoni, Van Dyk Mines at Benoni. In the 1960s Randfontein was virtually closed down, and mining was developed at Western Areas on the other side of the shallow valley, but in the 1970s new deposits were discovered to the south of Randfontein and the Cooke Section was opened up in 1976. Cooke produced gold and uranium, the uranium being destined for the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station fuel.  \n\nIn addition to the gold mines, 25% of De Beers and a controlling interest in Rustenburg Platinum Holdings, the world's largest platinum producer, JCI owned large industrial and property holdings, including the Houghton Estate in northern Johannesburg, and substantial shareholdings in South African Breweries, Toyota South Africa, Lennings Industrial, etc., and was long a target of developers who lusted after the property holdings. Anglo American Corporation purchased a 52% holding in JCI, agreeing to protect the company against predatory takeovers, and this situation continued until 1994.\n\nJCI installed a technically advanced Precious Metals Refinery at Rustenburg, which processed Platinum Group metals totally in South Africa, and built a ferrochrome smelter at Lydenburg which was the first in South Africa to directly smelt chromite fine ore. \n\nIn the late 1980s JCI started development of an ultra deep mine to the south of Western Areas, South Deep. The ownership of South Deep has now devolved to Gold Fields, and the deposit is still being developed as one of the largest low-grade gold deposits in the world.\n\nIn 1995 the majority shareholder, Anglo American Corp, decided to offer JCI to the new political dispensation in South Africa as a Black Economic Empowerment vehicle. A new Chairman, Mzi Khumalo, took over the mining side, whilst the property and investment side was separated and morphed into Johnnic Communications.

In less than ten years of operations, workers at Burchell Lake had mined an estimated 102 million pounds of ore.\n\nA number of recreational cottages are still located in the area.\n\nEasily accessible, Burchell Lake remained one of Ontario's best-preserved ghost towns for many years, with many of its buildings still standing at the townsite as of summer 2011. This included a dozen or so houses (some with basements), the original BA gas station, two room school, and collapsed recreation hall. The baseball cage could also be found with the original scoreboard. Street lamps, a sewer cover, and a fire hydrant also existed. Beginning in 2012 the mine site was remediated by Denison Environmental, with all surface structures demolished, mine openings properly sealed and mine wastes stabilized and covered with biosolids to encourage vegetation growth. \n\nA 40-year community reunion was held in nearby Shebandowan in 2007.Burchell Lake Reunion ", "title": "Burchell Lake"}

Also called sal soda or washing soda, natron was used as a salt for medicinal purposes, as a preservative for hides, and as an ingredient in the traditional manufacture of soap; herders also fed it to their animals. Natron deposits were located around the shore of Lake Chad and the wadis of Kanem Prefecture.\n\nNatron occurs naturally in two forms: white and black. More valuable commercially, hard blocks of black natron were exported to Nigeria. White natron was sold on local markets, principally in N'Djamena and farther to the south. Although efforts were made in the late 1960s to control the commercialization of natron through the creation of a parastatal, by 1970 those efforts had failed because of resistance by traditional chiefs and traders who controlled production through a system of perpetual indebtedness.\n\nA number of other mineral deposits are known, but none had been commercially exploited by the mid-1980s. Bauxite is found in the soudanian zone, and gold-bearing quartz is reported in Biltine Prefecture. Uranium is reported in the Aozou Strip, as are tin and tungsten in other parts of the Tibesti Mountains, but exploration reports in 1971 for these three minerals did not indicate large or rich deposits. As of 1987, conflicts in the region prevented further exploration.\n\nBy far the potentially most important resource is oil. In 1970, a consortium of Conoco, Shell, Chevron, and Exxon started exploration and in 1974 discovered minor oil deposits at S\u00e9digi, near Rig Rig, to the north of Lake Chad. Total reserves at S\u00e9digi were estimated at 60 million tons, or roughly  of oil. Exploration in 1985 by the Exxon-led consortium discovered potentially large deposits near Doba in the southern region of Chad. Further efforts were suspended in 1986 when world oil prices continued to drop, although the consortium maintained a liaison office in N'Djamena in 1988.\n\nPlans existed in the late 1970s to exploit the deposits at S\u00e9digi and to construct a small refinery at N'Djamena. Those plans lapsed during the conflicts of the late 1970s and early 1980s but were revived in 1986 by the government with the support of the World Bank. The reasons for proceeding with plans to exploit these deposits and build a refinery were clear. The cost of importing petroleum products exceeded the cost of extracting and refining domestic crude, even when international oil prices were low. The plans, which anticipated operations to begin in the early 1990s, included well development in the S\u00e9digi field, a pipeline to N'Djamena, a refinery with a 2,000- to  capacity, and the transformation or acquisition of power-generating equipment in the capital to burn the refinery's residual fuel oil.

''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.\n\nDuring the precolonial era, gold was extracted from small shafts dug into the earth or from river and streambeds and was traded at the coast or across the Sahara Desert. Efforts under the colonial administration to exploit gold deposits at Kokoumbo in the center of the country and at small mines in the southeast proved unprofitable. In 1984 the state-owned SODEMI and a French mining company formed the Ity Mining Company (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mini\u00e8res d'Ity\u2014SMI) to exploit a deposit discovered thirty years earlier at Ity near Danan\u00e9. Total investment in this period was estimated at CFA F1.2 billion. The gold ore was of medium quality, with a ratio of gold to ore in the range of 8.5\u00a0grams per ton. Extraction was to begin in 1987, with output anticipated at 700 kilograms of gold metal during the first two years of operation. Ity estimated an additional investment of CFA F2.3 billion to expand output to 700 kilograms of gold metal a year. SODEMI also located gold deposits in the region of Issia and in the Lobo River bed, with anticipated annual yields of 100 kilograms and 25 kilograms, respectively.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, low-grade deposits (less than 50 percent) of iron ore estimated at 585 million tons were assayed at Bangolo near the Liberian border. A consortium representing Japanese, French, British, American, Dutch, and Ivoirian interests was formed to exploit the deposits; however, depressed world prices for iron ore forced the participants to postpone the project indefinitely.\n\nFollowing World War II, diamond mining seemed promising, but by the mid-1980s expectations had waned.

Uniquely, it was possible to drive one's automobile through the mine, entering through the fan opening and exiting through the original entry.  The practice continued until 1970, when it was discontinued due to damage to the roof of the mine from car exhaust.\n\nThe site is also notable for its history of coke production on site for transportation by rail to steel mills.  Pocahontas coal was especially suitable for coking, and played a significant role in the industrial development of the United States. Coke and coal were shipped by rail to Norfolk, Virginia for trans-shipment to eastern US ports and overseas. Coking on the site was eventually discontinued, and the mine spoil pile now covers all but three beehive coking ovens. and \u00a0\n\nThis mine, when active, supplied the United States Navy a majority of its coal through both world wars.

Technology was advancing and reducing the number of miners required to do the work and allowed for the creation of the exhibition mine.

Named for the famous mine in Australia, the Burra Burra Mine extracted over 15 million tons (14 million metric tons) of copper ore during its 60 years of operation between 1899 and 1959.  The mine's remaining structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Burra Burra Mine Historic District.  The site is also home to the Ducktown Basin Museum, and the museum and mine are a Tennessee State Historic Site operated in partnership with the Tennessee Historical Commission.\n\nThe Burra Burra Mine was one of a number of mining operations in the Copper Basin from 1850 to 1987 that produced substantial amounts of copper ore that contained sulfur. Trees were cut to smelt the ore and burn off the sulfur.

{"text": "A bal maiden, from the Cornish language , a mine, and the English \"maiden\", a young or unmarried woman, was a female manual labourer working in the mining industries of Cornwall and western Devon, at the south-western extremity of Great Britain. The term has been in use since at least the early 18th\u00a0century. At least 55,000 women and girls worked as bal maidens, and the actual number is likely to have been much higher.\n\nWhile women worked in coal mines elsewhere in Britain, either on the surface or underground, bal maidens worked only on the surface. It is likely that Cornish women had worked in metal mining since antiquity, but the first records of female mine workers date from the 13th\u00a0century. After the Black Death in the 14th\u00a0century, mining declined, and no records of female workers have been found from then until the late 17th\u00a0century. Industrial improvements, the end of Crown control of metal mines, and rising demand for raw materials caused a boom in Cornish mining in the late 17th and early 18th\u00a0centuries. Increasing numbers of women and girls were recruited to the mines from about 1720, processing ore sent up by the male miners underground. The discovery of cheaper sources of copper in North Wales in the 1770s triggered a crash in the copper price, and many mines closed.\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution began in the late 18th and early 19th\u00a0centuries, the Welsh metal mines declined and mining in Cornwall and Devon became viable once more. Women and girls were recruited in large numbers for work in ore processing. Women and children accounted for up to half the workers in the area's copper mines. Although machinery was capable of performing much of the work done by bal maidens, the industry grew so quickly that the number of women and girls working grew steadily even though their numbers fell as a proportion of the workforce to 15\u201320% by 1850. At the peak of the Cornish mining boom, in around 1860, at least 6000 bal maidens were working at the region's mines; the actual number is likely to have been much higher. While it was not unusual for girls to become bal maidens at the age of six and to work into old age, they generally began at around age 10 or 11 and left work once they married.\n\nFrom the 1860s Cornish mines faced competition from cheap metal imports, and legislation introduced in the 1870s limited the use of child labour. The Cornish mining system went into terminal decline, leading to a collapse of the local economy and mass emigration both overseas and to other parts of the United Kingdom. In 1891 the number of bal maidens had fallen to half its peak, and by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 very few remained in employment. In 1921 Dolcoath mine, the last employer of bal maidens, ceased operations, bringing the tradition to an end. Other than women recruited for ore processing at Geevor as a result of labour shortages during the Second World War, and a very limited number of female workers after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 banned the practice of recruiting only male mineworkers, women never again performed manual labour in Cornish mines. The last surviving bal maiden died in 1968, and with the closure of South Crofty tin mine in 1998, Cornish metals mining came to an end.", "title": "Bal maiden"}

Coal mining in North Staffordshire began early in the 13th century, but the industry grew during the Industrial Revolution when coal mined in North Staffordshire was used in the local Potteries ceramics and iron industry (ironstone deposits were also found with the coal in certain areas).\n\nBefore the First World War, 20,000 men worked in the industry and over 50 pits were in operation. After nationalisation in 1947, the industry was gradually reduced in size as smaller pits closed or merged with larger, more modern mines. The industry began its final decline after the 1984-85 miners' strike and the last deep mine, Silverdale, closed on Christmas Eve 1998.", "title": "North Staffordshire Coalfield"}

{"text": "Friends of Coal is an advocacy group that functions in several states and works closely with state coal trade organizations.\nIt was founded in West Virginia by the coal industry as a countermeasure to grassroots environmental justice movements during the summer of 2002 over debates about legislation concerning weight limits on West Virginia highways for trucks carrying coal. It was brought to life after Warren Hylton, a coal operator, made a comment about how they should ask their friends for help. A marketing firm called Charles Ryan Associates helped create a backbone for the organization.https://kentuckycoal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/White-Paper-Friends-of-Coal-2013-1.pdf It subsequently broadened its efforts to improve the image of the coal industry and to link the coal industry to the economic and social self-identity of people who live near coal mines; as part of the latter effort, it sponsors local events like car shows and sports events. Friends of Coal also strives to create jobs for upcoming generations.\n\nFriends of Coal is also a controversial group because of their efforts to keep the coal industry in a high position.

It was originally formed after the merger of Oxiana Limited and Zinifex in 2008.\n\nIn 2009, Chinese state owned China Minmetals proposed a purchase of the heavily indebted company. The Chinese proposal was one of three high profile moves by Chinese firms to acquire stakes in the Australian mineral sector in early 2009. The China Minmetals offer along with other proposed purchases, especially the Chinalco planned stake in Rio Tinto, caused great public furor, adding political pressure to block Minmetals. The Australian government blocked the sale on 27 March 2009, citing concerns about the location of the Prominent Hill Mine within the sensitive military area. A deal not including Prominent Hill was approved, and the majority of the company was acquired by China Minmetals; the acquisitions became the company Minerals and Metals Group (MMG).http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/18/2602074.htm\n\nOZ Minerals has Prominent Hill Mine in production as both open pit and underground.

Originally part of the D&RGW's 3 ft 0 in (914 mm) narrow-gauge system, the 15 mile line connected with the rest of the narrow-gauge network at Poncha Junction, on the Marshall Pass line. The upper part of the Branch was on a 4.5% grade and included both an \"S\" curve and a double switchback to reach an elevation of over 10,000\u00a0ft (3,000 m). The line was converted to standard-gauge in 1956 after the narrow-gauge mainline from Salida to Gunnison was closed in the early 1950s. From that time forward, the line operated as a standard-gauge branch of the D&RGW until the early 1980s when Colorado Fuel & Iron closed its blast furnaces at Pueblo, Colorado.

By 1905 a full-scale silver rush was underway, and the town of Cobalt, Ontario sprang up to serve as its hub. By 1908 Cobalt produced 9% of the world's silver, and in 1911 produced 31,507,791 ounces of silver. However, the good ore ran out fairly rapidly, and most of the mines were closed by the 1930s. There were several small revivals over the years, notably in World War II and again in the 1950s, but both petered out and today there is no active mining in the area. In total, the Cobalt area mines produced 460 million ounces of silver.\nThe Cobalt Rush was instrumental in opening northern Ontario for mineral exploration.

The townsite was declared in 1936. It had no official post office in 1936; an unofficial one operated two days per week offering limited service.\n\nThe town's post office was robbed in 1937, with over \u00a3250 being stolen during the course of the night. The post office was part of the Emu mine premises and it was noted that the safe from which the money was stolen was found locked afterward.\n\nAt one point the town had a population of 500. The Agnew Hotel, still in operation, was built in 1945 amongst a row of shops on the main street and is all that is left of the town today. An old head frame of a stamp mill and the large tailing dumps of the East Murchison United gold mine also remain just outside the town.\n\nIn 1947 two prospectors, Charles Farranda and Alberto Bernardi, discovered a new gold find north of the Emu mine. The quartz reef containing coarse gold returned about 10oz per ton and was described as the best find in the district for years.\n\nThe town water supply failed in the same year when, following six days of calm weather, the windmill was unable to pump water from the town bore and most of the town's tanks had run dry. The town's population at the time was about 200 including 33 children. Water had been pumped by windmill from a well about  deep and then pumped to a raised  tank, then gravity fed back down to the town. Following the failure the residents refused to pay their rates to the Goldfields Water Supply Department.\n\nThe Emu mine closed in 1948; ore breaking stopped late in January and employees received a one-month notice of dismissal. The mine closed as a result of the high cost of production and the inability to secure capital for development work. Over 80 men were employed at the mine at the time.\n\nIn 1949 the Agnew gold mine closed.This was closely followed by the closure of the town's school as the number of enrolments dropped from 30 to 5. The population of the town fell from 150 to 25.\n\nThe Emu mine was severely flooded in 1989 resulting in the death of six men who were working underground at the time.\n\nAn operating gold mine is located adjacent to the townsite and is also named Agnew. The mine is owned by Gold Fields Ltd.\n\nIn early 2012 three miners were seriously injured when part of the mine collapsed.

The perishable portions of the earlier tipple have disappeared, leaving only the sandstone foundations and some artifacts buried in the tailings pile.\n\nThe second tipple was built in 1936 when Reliance Mine No. 7 was opened.

This tipple operated until 1955, when the Union Pacific Railroad, the chief consumer of the mine's coal, phased out steam locomotives.\n\nThe tipple operated as a sorting station for coal to be shipped from the Reliance Mine.  Loaded coal cars filled with mined coal were moved to a rotary car dumper at the south end of the tipple. The coal was dumped into a hopper, then moved to a shaker screen that sorted the coal by size. After sorting to slack, or powdered, nut, egg and lump, the coal went to a sorting table where debris was removed by hand. The sorted and inspected coal then went to chutes and hoppers for storage. Much of this equipment remains at the site.\n\nThe Reliance mines were opened in 1906-1907 to meet increasing demand for coal.

The Lardeau River runs into Trout Lake (the lake) and exits at the south end of the lake.  It then runs as does the lake on a southeastern course to the community of Lardeau at the north end of Kootenay Lake, while beyond it and the townsite of Trout Lake at its northwestern end is a low pass to the Beaton Arm of Upper Arrow Lake at Galena Bay.  Speculation on railway development through this pass promoted a great amount of speculation at Trout Lake, or Trout Lake City as it soon was proclaimed to be, as well as at Lardeau and other potential townsites along the rail line's route.\n\nHalcyon Hot Springs, originally a railway-era resort, is located approximately thirty minutes away on Highway 31 (later 23).  The Windsor Lodge Trout Lake BC has a restaurant and bar and there is also a gas station/convenience store located within Trout Lake City. A coffee shop/cafe, the No-Board Cafe opened in 2006 in Trout Lake City.  Long term residents do most of their grocery shopping in Nakusp, the nearest town, about forty-five minutes away. Trout Lake also has a general store which offers provisions and gasoline, operating out of the original Hladinec Esso garage.\n\nIn 1882, while surveying the land for railway development, Robert Sproule noted a large area of iron staining on the eastern shore of Kootenay lake. Large amounts of high-grade silver was discovered, setting off an explosion of prospecting activity around Trout Lake. Many new discoveries followed throughout the late 19th century. Trout Lake grew as a staging point and shipping hub for ore from the Silver Cup, Broadview, True Fissure, Great Northern, and Nettie L. mines. As demand for mining equipment and labour grew, so did the surrounding settlements of Ferguson and at Trout Lake. Trout Lake City has fluctuated in size and population since the 1870s primarily based on the boom and bust cycle of resource development.\n\nDespite the mineral wealth of the region, mining pursuits have been afflicted by the same adversities which were present in 1900. Effective development has often been handicapped by transportation difficulties and the propensity of unscrupulous businessmen to over-hype their claims. E.M. Morgan said in 1900, \"There's too many cheap-john jacklegs in the camp looking for something for nothing, and they find it. The result is they go down into the penny ante belt, float a jim-crow company, sell shares, find they have a wildcat, go broke and the shareholders in chorus condemn the country in general, instead of stringing up the 'floater'\".\n\nIn 2007 a new mining boom began with the production of molybdenite concentrates at Roca's MAX mine. This was relatively short-lived however, and the mine shut down in 2011 due to underground collapse and low molybdenum prices. The MAX mine processing facility and tailings pond have remained inoperative since the MAX mine closure in 2011.\n\nSubstantial mineral deposits remain in the vicinity of Trout Lake, and exploration and development work has been ongoing since the 1970s.", "title": "Trout Lake, British Columbia"}
{"text": "During the Middle Ages from the 5th century AD to the 16th century, Western Europe saw a blooming period for the mining industry. The first important mines here were those at Goslar in the Harz mountains, taken into commission in the tenth century. Another famous mining town is Falun in Sweden where copper has been mined since the thirteenth century.\nThe rise of Western European mining industry depended, of course, closely on the increasing weight of Western Europe on the stage of world history. Although the subject has sometimes been overlooked by historians, advances in Medieval mining and metallurgy made the flourishing of Western European civilization to a large extent possible.\n\nMetallurgical activities were also encouraged by central political power, regional authorities, monastic orders and ecclesiastical overlords, who always tried to have control and claimed Regalian rights over the mines and a share in the output, both in private lands and regions belonging to the Crown. They were particularly interested in the extraction of the precious metal ores, but not only, and for this reason the mines in their territories were open to all miners (Nef 1987, 706-715).", "title": "Mining and metallurgy in medieval Europe"}
{"text": "Mining archaeology is a specific field well-developed in the British Isles during recent decades. A reason of ongoing interest in this field is the particular bond between regional history and the exploitation of metals. References to mines in the area exist in Strabo's works. However the first accomplished study on the topic was attempted by Oliver Davies in 1935. Other momentous researches were that of geologist John S. Jackson about mines in Ireland and Lewis, Jones in Dolaucothi goldmine in Wales, and the pioneering work of Ronald F. Tylecote. Moreover, in the 1980s and 1990s a new generation of amateurs and scientists began investigations in different locations in the British Isles, including Duncan James on the Great Orme's Head, Simon Timberlake with the Early Mines Research Group at sites in Wales and William O'Brien in Ireland.", "title": "Mining archaeology in the British Isles"}
{"text": "The Desert Queen Mine was one of the more successful and long-lived mines of the high desert (Colorado Desert) in San Bernardino County, California. The abandoned mine is located in Joshua Tree National Park.\n\nThe mine is associated with Jim McHaney, a local cattle rustler, and Bill Keys, a noted rancher. The mine facilities are largely ruinous. The mine was not spectacularly successful but was sufficiently productive to remain in operation for nearly seventy-five years.\n\nThe mine itself consisted of several vertical and horizontal shafts, of which four vertical shafts, five inclined shafts, and ten horizontal adits remain. Tailings piles appear in several places, with quantities of machinery scattered about the site.\n\nThe mine was established by a man named Frank L. James in the early 1890s. The rich ore initially found prompted local outlaw gang leader and cattle rustler Jim McHaney to take over the mine. McHaney sent two of his men, Charley Martin and a man named Myers, to demand the mine from James. James refused, and Martin shot and killed him with a gun borrowed from Myers, after forcing James to sign over the property. Martin was acquitted of murder charges on grounds of self-defense.\n\nMcHaney initially prospered but borrowed heavily to expand and fell behind on payments to the bank, ultimately losing the mine. The mine passed into the hands of William F. Keys around 1917, who operated the mine until 1961.", "title": "Desert Queen Mine"}

The Good Hope quartz vein was found in 1874.Tom Hudson, Lake Elsinore Valley, its story 1776-1977, p. 36.Bill McBurney, Good Hope Mine, The Valley News, Friday, March 27th, 2009. Issue 13, Volume 13.William B. Clark, Gold districts of California, California Division of Mines and Geology, Sacramento, 1970, p. 175 Americans later bought the mine and worked it.\n\nThe mine was worked to a depth of 575 feet, with several levels 100 feet apart below the 250 foot level. The first levels, at 250 and 350 feet, extended nearly 1,000 feet in length. The 450 foot level did not extend as far.Los Angeles Mining Review, June 1, 1907\n\nThe formation in which the ore occurred is a fine, even-grained granodiorite. At the surface were several veins at distances varying from three to twenty feet. At greater depth, these branching fissures united to form an irregular vein, with a tendency to send off shoots into the surrounding rock, chiefly into the foot-wall side.The foot-wall streak often contained high grade ore. The auriferous iron sulfide was finely disseminated through the quartz.Los Angeles Mining Review, June 1, 1907\n\nIn 1881 with the arrival of the California Southern Railroad nearby at Pinacate a five-stamp mill was constructed to crush the ore from the mine and developed the underground quartz deposit. In the 1890s an eastern corporation, the Good Hope Mining Company, took control and brought in a twenty stamp mill which was powered by coal from nearby Terra Cotta, California.Bill McBurney, Good Hope Mine, The Valley News, Friday, March 27th, 2009. Issue 13, Volume 13.Report of the State Mineralogist, California State Mining Bureau, State Office, 1894, pp. 220-223\n\nOre from the Good Hope was one requiring fine crushing and very careful amalgamation and concentration. After the installation of the twenty stamp mill, water supplies were insufficient for efficient operation of the mill. The four concentrating machines were in operation, with very poor separation of sulfides. Under such conditions, it would have been better to run a ten stamp mill, which would have allowed greater extraction and increased net profits. As a result of the diminished efficiency, the tailings carried sufficient value to make them profitable to cyanide operators who subsequently worked them. Had there been less desire to maximize the volume of ore running through the mill and greater attention to efficiency, there would have remained little profit for the cyanide man.Los Angeles Mining Review, June 1, 1907\n\nThe mine produced about $2 million in gold before 1896.

{"text": "The Leadville miners' strike was a labor action by the Cloud City Miners' Union, which was the Leadville, Colorado local of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), against those silver mines paying less than $3.00 per day. The strike lasted from 19 June 1896 to 9 March 1897, and resulted in a major defeat for the union, largely due to the unified opposition of the mine owners. The failure of the strike caused the WFM to leave the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and is regarded as a cause for the WFM turn toward revolutionary socialism.\n\nSilver was discovered in Leadville, Colorado in the 1870s, initiating the Colorado Silver Boom. The Leadville miners' strike in 1896-97 occurred during rapid industrialization and consolidation of the mining industry. Mine owners had become more powerful, and they resolved not only to defeat the strike, but also to eliminate the union. The local union lost the strike and was nearly dissolved, marking a turning point for the local union's parent organization, the Western Federation of Miners (WFM).\n\nThe defeat forced miners to re-assess their tactics and their union philosophy. Although the federation was birthed as the result of a violent struggle and had engaged in a militant action in the Cripple Creek District in which miners used gunfire and dynamite, the organization's disposition and its Preamble envisioned a future of arbitration and conciliation with employers. After the Leadville strike, WFM leaders and their followers adopted radical politics and were open to more militant policies, breaking with the conservative, craft union based American Federation of Labor in the East.There is a difference between union militancy and union radicalism. Some of the most conservative unions have been quite militant. Unions can be militant in their tactics to preserve or protect the status quo, whether that be wages, jobs, or rights. When a union becomes radicalized, it invests philosophy and possibly resources toward the goal of changing the system.", "title": "Leadville miners' strike"}

{"text": "The 'Llancaiach Branch railway line was a mineral branch line in Glamorganshire, South Wales. It was authorised in 1836 as part of the Taff Vale Railway, and its purpose was to connect collieries at Llancaiach and bring their output to Cardiff for onward shipment. It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and built on the standard gauge. It opened in 1841 from a junction (later known as Stormstown Junction) with the Merthyr line immediately south of Abercynon (then called Navigation House). It was intended to be horse worked, and included a self-acting rope-worked inclined plane near the junction. The collieries were slow to use the line, preferring their customary use of a tramroad and the Glamorganshire Canal, and the value of the line was diminished when the Taff Vale Extension line, an east-west connecting line belonging to the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway, intersected it and cut off the colliery connections, and the line became dormant.\n\nIn 1878 the Taff Vale Railway tried to reinvigorate the line by building a line by-passing the inclined plane, with the intention of connecting with new collieries at the north end, but access over the Taff Vale Extension line was refused.\n\nIn 1884 a new connection from Pont Shon Norton, immediately north of Pontypridd, to Albion Colliery on the east side of the River Taff was opened, and in 1900 this line was extended north to join the Llancaiach line. A passenger train service operated through from Pontypridd to Nelson station, just short of the Taff Vale Extension line, but access to that line was still problematic.\n\nThe passenger service was popular at first, but it was discontinued in 1932, and as the coal industry declined, the branch was successively cut back, finally closing completely in 1970.", "title": "Llancaiach Branch"}

As with the 1892 strike, the 1899 incident culminated in a dynamite attack that destroyed a non-union mining facility, followed by military occupation of the district. \n\nThe confrontation of 1899 resulted from the miners' frustrations with mine operators that paid lower wages, hired Pinkerton or Thiel operatives to infiltrate the union; and routinely fired any miner who held a union card.", "title": "1899 Coeur d'Alene labor confrontation"}

{"text": "Mining in Bolivia has been a dominant feature of the Bolivian economy as well as Bolivian politics since 1557. Colonial era silver mining in Bolivia, particularly in Potos\u00ed, played a critical role in the Spanish Empire and the global economy. Tin mining supplanted silver by the twentieth century and the central element of Bolivian mining, and wealthy tin barons played an important role in national politics until they were marginalized by the industry's nationalization into the Bolivian Mining Corporation that followed the 1952 revolution. Bolivian miners played a critical part to the country's organized labor movement from the 1940s to the 1980s. \n\nBy 1985, however, the production of every significant mineral in the country had failed to exceed the output registered in 1975. Moreover, the international tin market crashed in 1985. The mining sector in 1987 accounted for only 4 percent of GDP, 36 percent of exports, 2.5 percent of government revenues, and 2 percent of the labor force, compared with 8 percent of GDP, 65 percent of exports, 27 percent of government revenues, and about 6 percent of the labor force in 1977. Spurred by a massive increase in gold production, however, the mining sector rebounded in 1988, returning to the top of the nation's list of foreign exchange earners.\n\nThe crisis of 1985 prompted emergency economic measures by the government, including massive layoffs of miners. The twenty-first century has seen a recovery and expansion of the mining sector, and the government of Evo Morales has re-nationalized several facilities. However,  mining in Bolivia is primarily in private hands, while the vast majority of miners work in cooperatives. Large, foreign owned mines such as Sumitomo's San Crist\u00f3bal mine also produce relatively large quantities of minerals. In 2010, 79,043 miners worked in the sector, producing $2.642 billion of mineral products. , Bolivia is the world's sixth largest producer of tin.", "title": "Mining in Bolivia"}

It is used primarily to transport iron ore (60 million tonnes per year) and does not carry passenger traffic.\n\nThe Sishen\u2013Saldanha line was built by Iscor, the then iron and steel parastatal, opening in 1976.\n\nIn 1977 the line was transferred to Transnet Freight Rail, then known as South African Railways & Harbours, and a decision was made to electrify the line. A voltage of 50 kV AC was chosen instead of the usual 25 kV in order to haul heavier loads and to allow a larger distance between transformers.\n\nA single-track line with ten crossing loops to allow trains travelling in opposite directions to pass was constructed; number of crossing loops has since increased to 19 in order to increase line capacity.\n\nFrom an altitude of  at Sishen, the line climbs for  before descending to cross the Orange River about  downstream of Groblershoop.

{"text": "Spring Creek Debris Dam is an earthfill dam on Spring Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, in Shasta County in the U.S. state of California. Completed in 1963, the dam, maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, serves primarily to collect severe acid mine drainage stemming from the Iron Mountain Mine. The dam forms the Spring Creek Reservoir, less than  long. Spring Creek and South Fork Spring Creek flow into the reservoir from a  watershed. The dam is directly upstream from the city of Keswick, California and the Keswick Reservoir.\nThe operation is part of the Trinity River Division of the Central Valley Project.\n\nThe primary purpose of the Spring Creek Dam was to collect acid mine drainage from the old Iron Mountain Mine, which was heavily polluting Spring Creek and its tributaries. The dam was built in response to these pollutants that were contaminating the Sacramento River, the primary water supply for millions of Californians. Although the watershed is small in comparison to that of the Sacramento River, the stream is among the most polluted and acidic in the world.\n\nThe dam and reservoir, along with other treatment structures built at and below the mine, have successfully reduced the dry weather pollution of Spring Creek by up to ninety-five percent. Problems, though, still occur mainly in the form of large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir. Several concerns about the structural integrity and safety of the dam, both physically and biologically, arose in the 1990s. Emergency releases from Shasta Lake, often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water, have occurred from time to time to dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage.", "title": "Spring Creek Dam"}

{"text": "The Coal Creek War was an early 1890s armed labor uprising in the southeastern United States that took place primarily in Anderson County, Tennessee. This labor conflict ignited during 1891 when coal mine owners in the Coal Creek watershed began to remove and replace their company-employed, private coal miners then on the payroll with convict laborers leased out by the Tennessee state prison system.\n\nThese former wage-earning Coal Creek coal miners repeatedly attacked and burned both state prison stockades and mine properties, all while releasing hundreds of the state convict laborers from their bondage to the mine companies. Many of these same Coal Creek coal miners were also wounded or killed in small-arms skirmishes during the Coal Creek War, along with dozens of Tennessee state militiamen.\n  \nOne historian describes the Coal Creek War as \"one of the most dramatic and significant episodes in all American labor history.\"Perry Cotham, Toil, Turmoil & Triumph: A Portrait of the Tennessee Labor Movement (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 1995), pp. 56-80.\n\nThe Coal Creek War was itself part of a greater labor struggle across Tennessee that was launched against the state government's controversial convict-leasing system, which allowed the state prison system to lease convict labor to mining companies (and other business enterprises) with the effect of suppressing employee wages in the open market across the state.  The outbreak of this labor conflict touched off a partisan media firestorm between the miners' supporters and detractors, and brought the issue of convict leasing to the public debate.\n\nAlthough the Coal Creek War essentially ended with the arrests of hundreds of former company coal miners during 1892, the adverse exposure that this state conflict with private labor generated nationwide led to the downfall of Governor John P. Buchanan, and forced the Tennessee General Assembly to reconsider its state convict labor-leasing system.James B. Jones, Convict Lease Wars.  Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002.

{"text": "Silver Centre is a ghost town in Timiskaming District, Northeastern Ontario, Canada, situated in South Lorrain Township. It is located approximately  south of North Cobalt, and  west of Highway 567. Silver Centre was a secondary camp to the great silver fields of Cobalt, discovered in 1903. There are no current residents in Silver Centre. It is still an active mineral field and does at times have active mineral exploration.\n\nThe first discovery of silver in the area was made in the 1874 by a lumberman named Pat Manion. He blazed a stump as a witness or discovery tree and showed his sample to his fellow workers at the bunkhouse; everybody believed the sample to be common lead, and Manion agreed. A decade later while discussing his find to a young geologist, Manion quite surprised, discovered that the sample was nearly pure silver. Manion returned to the Ryan Timber Limit where he searched in vain for the location, but was unsuccessful in his attempt. The story of Manion's lost silver mine became legendary throughout the Gatineau-Ottawa region. In August 1903 silver was quickly discovered near the railway bed during the construction of the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway. The discovery made at Long Lake,  north of North Bay, was spectacular. And within one year a silver rush occurred and subsequently the town of Cobalt was established to cater to the world's greatest silver region.\n\nThe South Lorrain camp produced the Keeley \"nugget\", which weighed 4,402 pounds and contained 24,222 ounces of silver.", "title": "Silver Centre"}
{"text": "This is a list of charters promulgated by kings of England that specifically relate to Cornwall, which was incorporated into the Kingdom of England late in the Anglo-Saxon period. In the 9th and 10th centuries, the kings of Wessex became the rulers of Cornwall, and after a period of independence during the wars with the Danes, this rule by the kings of England became permanent (see History of Cornwall). The charters below relate either to the tin mines of Cornwall and Devon or to the Earldom or Duchy of Cornwall. The stannary charters are dated between 1201 and 1508, the others between 1231 and 1338.\n\nIn 1337, the earldom of Cornwall was made into a royal duchy to support the heir to the throne. Centralisation in the reign of Henry VIII meant that Cornwall's distinct status was no longer recognised in royal documents; though unlike the situation for Wales, no legislation was enacted to formalise this. The rights of the Duke of Cornwall still rely on medieval legislation. When no one is duke of Cornwall, the lands and rights of the Duchy are exercised by the Crown since the heir apparent may not always inherit the Duchy.", "title": "Royal charters applying to Cornwall"}
{"text": "The 2009 Harmony Gold mine deaths occurred in late May and early June 2009 in Free State province, South Africa. At least 82 miners, many from Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, died from inhalation of poisonous gasses created by a May 18 fire in the mineshaft.\n\nCritically, the ranks of unemployed, independent and redundant miners are unofficially tolerated within unsecured, less-profitable mines. Consequently, in reports from Africa the dead are being officially defined as \"illegal miners\" \u2014 or \"trespassers\" \u2014 onto the mineral-claims of the larger corporate mining operators and market consortiums which traditionally depend on government-supported mineral-extraction concessions and export rights granted in areas such as Free State. A former police officer with 12 years' experience in cases of \"illegal mining\" said he feared that hundreds more bodies of \"illegals\" could still be underground in mines in the city of Welkom, according to a report in the leading Afrikaans daily, Beeld. He estimated that about 3,000 illegal miners work underground in the mines in Welkom alone. \"Illegal mining: More bodies found at Free State mine\", Mail & Guardian (Johannesberg) online (June 4, 2009 12:55)\n\nThe affected mine (the Eland shaft \"Harmony reports success in combating criminal mining\", Harmony News Release (1 June 2009) ) is owned by Harmony Gold. Africa's third-largest gold producer and the fifth-largest in the world, Harmony is especially exposed to trespassers because the company followed a strategy of buying up old, abandoned or marginally productive mines (alongside controversial, environmentally expensive extraction techniques), which fell into disuse when gold prices were lower.

{"text": "The Great County Adit, sometimes called the County Adit, or the Great Adit was a system of interconnected adits that helped drain water from the tin and copper mines in the Gwennap area of Cornwall, in the United Kingdom. Construction started in 1748 and it eventually reached a length of over 40 miles (65\u00a0km) of underground tunnel, providing drainage to over 100 mines at an average depth of 80-100m.Buckley, p.13\nThe adit was the brainchild of John Williams (born 1714) of Scorrier who was the manager of Poldice mine. Although work was started in 1748, it did not reach Poldice mine until the late 1760s. By 1778 the adit had been extended past Wheal Busy to Wheal Peevor, and another branch, known as the Consols Adit was driven west in the 1770s and 80s to drain the Consolidated Mines and United Mines.Buckley, pp.47\u201349 By 1792 a branch from Poldice extended to Wheal Unity.\n\nThe portal of the adit is in the Carnon Valley below the hamlet of Twelveheads. In 1839, probably at its peak, it discharged over 14.5 million gallons (66 million litres) of water per day into the Carnon River. At that time the adit had more steam engines pumping into it than were used by the whole of continental Europe and America combined.\n\nThe Carnon River empties into Restronguet Creek (a tidal arm of the Carrick Roads upstream from Falmouth). Major floods in the winter of 1876 caused large quantities of gangue and silt to be washed into the higher part of Restronguet Creek, permanently damaging navigational access to the upper quays at Devoran.\n\nAlthough all the mines served by the Great County Adit have closed and it is unmaintained, it still drains many of their underground workings today; in the summer of 1980 the flow was 500,000 gallons per day.Buckley, p.80", "title": "Great County Adit"}

Shea, along with his mate Samuel Miller, was killed in November 1872 by \"absconding\" indentured workers while on an expedition to Mukkine (now Muccanoo Pool on Muccan Station), on the De Grey River to \"recover the services of some native divers who had broken faith with him\".\n\nShay Gap was a company town, developed by Mount Goldsworthy Mining Associates to service nearby iron ore mines. The town was designed in 1970 by Lawrence Howroyd, for whom it won an Award of Merit in the 1974 Prince Philip Prize for Australian Design.\nIron ore production started in January 1973.\n \nAt its peak, the town had a population of over 850 people. Mining activities ceased on 10 December 1993 and the town was closed in February 1994. Buildings and structures were either sold, demolished or relocated to Yarrie.", "title": "Shay Gap, Western Australia"}

{"text": "Cobalt is a chemical element with the symbol Co and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural meteoric iron. The free element, produced by reductive smelting, is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray metal.\n\nCobalt-based blue pigments (cobalt blue) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists [citation needed] to be due to the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.\n\nToday, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as cobaltite (CoAsS). The element is however more usually produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining. The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Zambia yields most of the global cobalt production. The DRC alone accounted for more than 50% of world production in 2016 (123,000 tonnes), according to Natural Resources Canada.\n\nCobalt is primarily used in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.\n\nCobalt is the active center of a group of coenzymes called cobalamins. Vitamin B, the best-known example of the type, is an essential vitamin for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a micronutrient for bacteria, algae, and fungi.", "title": "Cobalt"}

The post office, named \"Poeville\", operated between September 1, 1874, and March 24, 1878.\n\nThe smelting of the sulfide-rich ores with the primitive technology of the time directly at town was difficult, and also water resources were scarce. The situation improved in 1866, when the extracted ore was freighted to smelters by wagon to Cisco, California, and, after the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad, by rail to Sacramento, California.

Silver Reef was established after John Kemple, a prospector from Nevada, discovered a vein of silver in a sandstone formation in 1866. At first, geologists were uncertain about Kemple's find because silver is not usually found in sandstone. In 1875, two bankers from Salt Lake City sent William Barbee to the site to stake mining claims. He staked 21 claims, and an influx of miners came to work Barbee's claims and to stake their own. To accommodate the miners, Barbee established a town called Bonanza City. Property values there were high, so several miners settled on a ridge to the north of it and named their settlement \"Rockpile\".  The town was renamed Silver Reef after silver mines in nearby Pioche closed and businessmen arrived.\n\nBy 1879, about 2,000 people were living in Silver Reef. The town had a mile-long Main Street with many businesses, among them a Wells Fargo office, the Rice Building, and the Cosmopolitan Restaurant. Although adjacent to many settlements with a majority of Mormon residents, the town never had a meeting house for Latter-day Saints, only a Catholic church. In 1879, a fire destroyed several businesses, but the residents rebuilt them. Mines were gradually closed, most of them by 1884, as the worldwide price of silver dropped. By 1901, most of the buildings in town had either been demolished or moved to Leeds.\n\nIn 1916, mining operations in Silver Reef resumed under the direction of Alex Colbath, who organized the area's mines into the Silver Reef Consolidated Mining Company. These mines were purchased by American Smelting and Refining Company in 1928, but the company did minimal work as a result of the Great Depression. The Western Gold & Uranium Corporation purchased Silver Reef's mines in 1948, and in 1951, they began mining uranium in the area. These operations did not last long either, and the Western Gold & Uranium Corporation sold their mines to the 5M Corporation in 1979.

The state-owned Reichswerke was seen as a vehicle of hastening growth in ore mining and steel output regardless of private capitalists' plans and opinions, which ran contrary to Adolf Hitler's strategic vision. In November 1937 Hermann G\u00f6ring obtained unchecked access to state financing and launched a chain of mergers, diversifying into military industries with the absorption of Rheinmetall. G\u00f6ring himself supervised the Reichswerke but did not own it in any sense and did not make personal profit from it directly, although at times he withdrew cash for personal expenses.Overy, p. 145.\n\nAfter the Anschluss, the Reichswerke absorbed Austrian heavy industries, including those owned by private German investors. The cluster of steel mills and supporting companies in Linz became its most important asset.

A company was to pay the tax when its annual profits reach $75 million, a measure designed so as not to burden small business.

{"text": "Coal mining in the United Kingdom dates back to Roman times and occurred in many different parts of the country. Britain's coalfields are associated with Northumberland and  Durham, North and South Wales, Yorkshire, the Scottish Central Belt, Lancashire, Cumbria, the East and West Midlands and Kent.  After 1970, coal mining quickly collapsed and practically disappeared in the 21st century.  The consumption of coal \u2013 mostly for electricity \u2013 fell from 157 million tonnes in 1970 to 18 million tonnes in 2016. Of the coal mined, 77% of  supplies were imported from Colombia, Russia and the United States. Of the coal mined in the UK in 2016 all was from open-cast coal mines. Employment in coal mines fell from a peak of 1,191,000 in 1920 to 695,000 in 1956, 247,000 in 1976, 44,000 in 1993, and to 2,000 in 2015.Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, \"Historical coal data: coal production, availability and consumption 1853 to 2015\" (2016) online\n\nAlmost all onshore coal resources in the UK occur in rocks of the Carboniferous age, some of which extend under the North Sea.

Its small stream drains westward into Canyon Ferry Lake, on the upper Missouri River near present-day Townsend, Montana. In 1864, Confederate soldiers on parole during the American Civil War made a minor gold discovery in the gulch, but the discovery of the sensationally rich Montana Bar the following year\u2014one of the richest placer strikes per acre ever made\u2014led to other rich gold strikes up and down the gulch, and touched off a frantic boom period of placer gold mining in the area that extended through 1869. From 1866 to 1869, the gulch equaled or outstripped all other mining camps in the Montana Territory in gold production, producing an estimated $19\u201330 million worth of gold (in late 1860s dollars). For a time, Confederate Gulch was the largest community in Montana. In 1866, Montana had a total population of 28,000, and of these, about 10,000 (35%) were working in Confederate Gulch.Diamond City grew to a claimed size of ten thousand\n\nThe main boomtown serving the miners at Confederate Gulch was Diamond City (). During its heyday, Diamond City was the county seat of Montana's Meagher County, though today the area is part of Broadwater County. While gold production was at its height, Diamond City roared along both night and day. In their frantic efforts to get at more gold, the miners built ditches and flumes that extended for miles, and employed high pressure hydraulic mining methods which washed down whole hillsides and ate up the gulch floor. The hydraulic mining process left huge spoil banks in the gulch and eventually consumed the original site of Diamond City, which had to be moved to a new location.\n\nBy 1870, the gold supply at Confederate Gulch had been exhausted, the boom was over and the residents of Diamond City simply picked up and left. In 1870, there were only 255 people remaining, and a year later only about 60. Today hardly a trace remains of Diamond City or the other gulch communities. An unimproved road still winds up the gulch from the Missouri River valley and crosses the top of the Big Belts on its way down to the Smith River valley.

{"text": "Cut-Off grade is the minimum grade required in order for a mineral or metal to be economically mined (or processed). Material found to be above this grade is considered to be ore, while material below this grade is considered to be waste.\n\nThe cut-off grade can be determined through a variety of methods, each of varying complexity. Cut-off grades are selected to achieve a certain objective, such as resource utilization or economic benefit. Dividing these objectives even further gives way to specific goals such as the maximization of total profits, immediate profits, and present value. It is important to recognize that the cut-off grade is not simply calculated to a definitive answer. It is in fact a strategic variable that has major implications on mine design. The cut-off grade is adapted as the economic environment changes with regard to metal prices and mining costs, and is therefore a constantly changing. Metal value is not the only factor affecting the profitability of a block. The presence of unwanted (often hazardous) material in a block may increase the processing cost. This should also be considered when classifying waste rock and ore.\n\nCategory:Mining engineering\nCategory:Mineral economics", "title": "Cutoff grade"}

{"text": "Potholes are frequently encountered during mining operations in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa. Two orebodies, the Upper Group 2 (UG2) and the Merensky Reef, host about 70% of the world's platinum group metals (PGM), and pose major extraction problems for the mining industry in their faults, dykes, joints, domes, iron-rich ultramafic pegmatoids, rolls and dunite pipes. The greatest mining problems, though, are presented by potholes.\n\nThe massive intrusion of molten magma, predating the nearby Vredefort impact by at least 30 million years, led to partial to complete melting of the cumulus floor already in place. Flow and turbulence, high temperatures and chemical reactions, sculpted and potholed the surface of the floor in a process similar to the erosion caused by running water. With the end of the outpouring, when emplacement ceased, cooling of the magma started, leaving the potholes filled, and creating a fault surface at the interface of the pothole and the filling magma. The final phase was when crystallisation of chromitite was followed by that of pyroxene and plagioclase, while the contents of the potholes, also consisting of UG2 or Merensky Reef, but having followed a different cooling profile, showed little or no crystallisation of chromitite.\n\nThe problems posed by potholes to mining operations are rooted in the fracturing and fragmentation of the material in potholes and their surroundings. These lead to ground instabilities, especially in the hanging wall, and serious safety hazards. Mining is generally abandoned when more than about 40% of the raise line is potholed. A crew for developing new raise lines is usually on standby for such cases, incurring considerable development and labour costs.\n\nIn horizontal section potholes are roughly circular to elliptical and vary in diameter from 20 m to more than 1\u00a0km.

{"text": "Jig concentrators are devices used mainly in the mining industry for mineral processing, to separate particles within the ore body, based on their specific gravity (relative density).\nThe particles would usually be of a similar size, often crushed and screened prior to being fed over the jig bed. There are many variations in design; however the basic principles are constant: The particles are introduced to the jig bed (usually a screen) where they are thrust upward by a pulsing water column or body, resulting in the particles being suspended within the water. As the pulse dissipates, the water level returns to its lower starting position and the particles once again settle on the jig bed. As the particles are exposed to gravitational energy whilst in suspension within the water, those with a higher specific gravity (density) settle faster than those with a lower count, resulting in a concentration of material with higher density at the bottom, on the jig bed. The particles are now concentrated according to density and can be extracted from the jig bed separately. In the mining of most heavy minerals, the denser material would be the desired mineral and the rest would be discarded as floats (or tailings). \n\nThere are some minerals, notably coal, that are lighter (lower in density) than the surrounding rock and in such instances the process of extraction would work in reverse, i.e. the coal would settle on top with the rock below (on the jig bed). There are several designs and methods of extraction from the jig bed.", "title": "Jig concentrators"}

It was sunk on Great Boys farm, which in 1778 was described as a \"messuage with eight Cheshire acres of land\" on the north side of Sale Lane west of the Colliers Arms public house. It was owned by William Atkin and sold in 1855 to mineowners, John Fletcher of Bolton and Samuel Scowcroft. By 1869 their partnership was dissolved and the company became John Fletcher and Sons in 1877. Shafts were sunk for a colliery on Pear Tree Farm on the corner of Mort Lane and Sale Lane which appear in the 1867 Mines Lists and became part of Great Boys Colliery.  Fletcher and Schofield were granted permission to construct a mineral railway to join the London and North Western Railway's Tyldesley Loopline in 1868 but there is no evidence that it was built. The colliery closed before 1885. The colliery accessed the Brassey mine (coal seam) at about 170 yards and the Six Foot mine at 182 yards.

At the town of Cornwall, California the railroad crossed the tracks of the Southern Pacific Railroad using an overhead trestle. \n\nIt was mostly standard gauge, however there was a small segment that was narrow gauge from the mine portals to coal bunkers.\n  \nThe railroad had four locomotives, two built in San Francisco by H. J. Booth at the Union Iron Works, Note that archive version is formatted with black text on a black background. one built in San Francisco by Vulcan Iron Works and one from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Three locomotives had names: The D. O. Mills (named after Darius Ogden Mills), the Hayward (named after Alvinza Hayward), and the Black Diamond.  One locomotive was a narrow-gauge engine that was used to bring mine cars from the mine portals to the bunkers.\n\nTrains ran by gravity from Nortonville to Black Diamond Landing because it was all downhill.    \n\nThe railroad was abandoned in about 1885 when the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company closed its mine at Nortonville and moved all of its employees to another of the Company's mines at Black Diamond, Washington Territory.\n\nIn 1888, two of its locomotives, the D. O. Mills and the Black Diamond were transferred to the Bellingham Bay and British Columbia Railroad (\"BB&BC\") in the state of Washington.  The BB&BC was a company that had strong ties to the Black Diamond Coal Mining Company because the two companies had the same management.

{"text": "The shear strength of a discontinuity in a soil or rock mass may have a strong impact on the mechanical behavior of a soil or rock mass. The shear strength of a discontinuity is often considerably lower than the shear strength of the blocks of intact material in between the discontinuities, and therefore influences, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope engineering, but also the stability of natural slopes. Many slopes, natural and man-made, fail due to a low shear strength of discontinuities in the soil or rock mass in the slope. The deformation characteristics of a soil or rock mass are also influenced by the shear strength of the discontinuities. For example, the modulus of deformation is reduced, and the deformation becomes plastic (i.e. non-reversible deformation on reduction of stress) rather than elastic (i.e. reversible deformation). This may cause, for example, larger settlement of foundations, which is also permanent even if the load is only temporary. Furthermore, the shear strength of discontinuities influences the stress distribution in a soil or rock mass.", "title": "Shear strength (discontinuity)"}

{"text": "An Arrastra (or Arastra) is a primitive mill for grinding and pulverizing (typically) gold or silver ore. The simplest form of the arrastra is two or more flat-bottomed drag stones placed in a circular pit paved with flat stones, and connected to a center post by a long arm. With a horse, mule or human providing power at the other end of the arm, the stones were dragged slowly around in a circle, crushing the ore. Some arrastras were  powered by a water wheel; a few were powered by steam or gasoline engines, and even electricity.\n\nArrastras were widely used throughout the Mediterranean region since Phoenician times. The Spanish introduced the arrastra to the New World in the 16th century. The word \"arrastra\" comes from the Spanish language arrastar, meaning to drag along the ground. Arrastras were suitable for use in small or remote mines, since they could be built from local materials and required little investment capital.\n\nFor gold ore, the gold was typically recovered by amalgamation with quicksilver. The miner would add clean mercury to the ground ore, continue grinding, rinse out the fines, then add more ore and repeat the process. At cleanup, the gold amalgam was carefully recovered from the low places and crevices in the arrastra floor. The amalgam was then heated in a distillation retort to recover the gold, and the mercury was saved for reuse.\n\nFor silver ore, the patio process, invented in Mexico in 1554, was generally used to recover the silver from ore ground in the arrastra.", "title": "Arrastra"}

The sliding criterion has been developed for stresses that would occur in slopes between , hence, in the order of maximum .

{"text": "Corporate finance is an area of finance that deals with sources of funding, the capital structure of corporations, the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. The primary goal of corporate finance is to maximize or increase shareholder value.See Corporate Finance: First Principles, Aswath Damodaran, New York University's Stern School of Business Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms.\n\nCorrespondingly, corporate finance comprises two main sub-disciplines. Capital budgeting is concerned with the setting of criteria about which value-adding projects should receive investment funding, and whether to finance that investment with equity or debt capital.  Working capital management is the management of the company's monetary funds that deal with the short-term operating balance of current assets and current liabilities; the focus here is on managing cash, inventories, and short-term borrowing and lending (such as the terms on credit extended to customers).\n\nThe terms corporate finance and corporate financier are also associated with investment banking. The typical role of an investment bank is to evaluate the company's financial needs and raise the appropriate type of capital that best fits those needs. Thus, the terms \"corporate finance\" and \"corporate financier\" may be associated with transactions in which capital is raised in order to create, develop, grow or acquire businesses. Recent legal and regulatory developments in the U.S. will likely alter the makeup of the group of arrangers and financiers willing to arrange and provide financing for certain highly leveraged transactions.\n\nFinancial management overlaps with the financial function of the accounting profession.

The technique did not attract attention until licences use were awarded for onshore shale gas exploration in 2008.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, as in other countries\u2014and in particular the United States, where the industry is most advanced and widespread, hydraulic fracturing has generated a large amount of controversy. Although hydraulic fracturing is often used synonymously to refer to shale gas and other unconventional oil and gas sources, it is not always correct to associate it with unconventional gas.\n\nIn late May 2011, the first UK exploration for shale gas using high-volume hydraulic fracturing was suspended at Preese Hall in Lancashire after the process triggered two minor earthquakes. The larger of the earthquakes caused minor deformation of the wellbore and was strong enough to be felt.\n\nThe report of 2012 by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering concluded that earthquake risk was minimal, and recommended the process be given nationwide clearance, although it highlighted certain concerns which led to changes in regulations.\n\nIn January 2014, the European Commission issued a set of recommendations on the minimum principles for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons from shale formations using high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Updated guidance for the public was issued by the British government in January 2017.\n\nIn March 2019, the High Court found the UK government's policy was unlawful and failed to consider the climate impact of shale gas extraction.", "title": "Hydraulic fracturing in the United Kingdom"}

The National Heritage Area recognizes the area's cultural and historic qualities and serves to promote tourism, historic preservation and economic development in the region. The idea of the NCHA was first proposed in the early 1990s by Congressman Nick Rahall, and was established on November 12, 1996 by the 1996 Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act. The designated area includes Boone, Cabell, Fayette, Logan, Lincoln, McDowell, Mercer, Mingo, Raleigh, Summers, and Wayne counties.\nExploitation of coal in West Virginia began in the 1840s with the mining and refining of cannel coal in the Kanawha Valley. The principal coal fields in the Heritage Area include the New River, Winding Gulf and Flat Top-Pocahontas coal fields, of which the Pocahontas No. 3 seam was the most valuable. As the coalfields were exploited a network of railroads were developed, primarily by the Chesapeake and Ohio, the Norfolk and Western and the Virginian railways, the latter two associated with the Pocahontas and Winding Gulf fields, respectively.

{"text": "__NOTOC__\n\nA gook was a piece of protective headgear worn by bal maidens (female manual labourers in the mining industries of Cornwall and Devon). The gook was a bonnet which covered the head and projected forward over the face, to protect the wearer's head and face from sunlight and flying debris. Bal maidens often worked outdoors or in very crude surface-level shelters, and the gook also gave protection from extreme weather conditions. By covering the ears, gooks protected the ears from the noisy industrial environment.\n\nWhile there was some regional variation in style, gooks would generally be tied under the chin and around the neck, and fall loose from the neck over the shoulders to protect the shoulders and upper arms. In bright sunlight, the wearer would sometimes pin the gook across her face, leaving only the eyes exposed. Gooks for use in winter were made of felt or padded cotton with cardboard stiffening to allow the top to project forward over the face, and in summer of cotton. Although gooks were traditionally white in colour, the lightweight summer gooks were sometimes made of bright cotton prints.\n\nIn the 19th century bal maidens began to wear straw hats in summer instead of cotton gooks. By the end of the 19th century, these straw bonnets had largely replaced the gook year-round. By this time the Cornish mining industry was in terminal decline, and very few bal maidens remained in employment.\n\nWhen some bal maidens were re-hired to work in a temporarily expanded mining industry during the First World War (1914\u201318), traditional clothing was abandoned and gooks were largely replaced by more practical wool or fur hats. Gooks did not die out completely, and records exist of at least some bal maidens continuing to wear the gook until the early 1920s.\n\nIn 1921 Dolcoath, the last mine in Cornwall to employ female manual labourers, was closed, and the use of bal maidens ceased. Although some female manual labourers were employed by the mines in the 1940s and early 1950s owing to labour shortages caused by the Second World War, and a very limited number of female workers were employed after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 ended the policy of recruiting only men for underground work in the few surviving mines, these women wore practical clothing similar to those of male workers. In 1998 Cornwall's last surviving tin mine at South Crofty closed, bringing mining in Devon and Cornwall to an end.", "title": "Gook (headgear)"}

{"text": "Breaking the News is an 1887 painting by Australian artist John Longstaff. It shows the interior of a miner's cottage on the Victorian goldfields with an old man breaking the news to a woman of her husband's death in a mining accident. The woman holds an infant in her arms, and two other miners appear in the doorway, carrying the body of the husband on a stretcher. Behind them in the distance stands the mine's headframe. Breaking the News became etched in the popular imagination, and by the 1890s was \"known by reproduction in every mining township in Australia\".The Argus, 29 June 1895\n\nPainted when Longstaff was still an art student, it won him the National Gallery of Victoria Art School's first travelling scholarship in 1887.Astbury, Leigh (1986). \"Longstaff, Sir John Campbell (1861\u20131941)\", Australian Dictionary of Biography. Retrieved 7 March 2016. The Argus described it as \"a vivid and accurate presentment of a familiar incident in Australian life\".The Argus, 19 April 1887. Only one month after the painting was first exhibited in Melbourne, eighty-one coal miners perished in a gas explosion at the Bulli Mine in New South Wales. The New Australasian Gold Mine disaster, Australia's worst below-ground gold mining disaster, occurred on 12 December 1882 in Creswick, less than twenty kilometres from Longstaff's hometown of Clunes. According to biographer Nina Murdoch, Longstaff's childhood memory of a mining fatality was the direct inspiration for Breaking the News: \"the day at Clunes, following the tragic cort\u00e8ge from mine-head to cottage door, he had heard the stricken cry of the young wife at the sight of the stretcher-bearers' burden\".Murdoch, Nina. Portrait in Youth. Sydney: Angus and Robertson, 1948. pp. 54-55\n\nRenowned Australian writer and poet Henry Lawson declared himself a \"worshipper\" of Longstaff after viewing Breaking the News, and discussed the painting's sentimental and social impact at length in an 1899 essay for The Bulletin titled \"If I Could Paint\", concluding that he'd \"be prouder of a picture like Breaking the News than of a hundred exquisite alleged studies in the \"nood\".\"Lawson, Henry (11 November 1899). \"If I Could Paint\", The Bulletin. The following year, The Bulletin co-founder and then-owner of Breaking the News, J. F. Archibald, commissioned Longstaff to paint a portrait of Lawson. Archibald greatly admired the portrait, prompting him to set up a bequest for the Archibald Prize, now Australia's most prestigious prize for portraiture.Henry Lawson (1900) by John Longstaff, Art Gallery of New South Wales. Retrieved 26 November 2012. Longstaff went on to win the Archibald five times.\n\nBreaking the News was the inspiration for a 1912 film of the same name. Directed by W. J. Lincoln and shot near Melbourne, it depicts the flooding of an underground mine and daring attempts to rescue the miners. The film was a commercial success and received favourable reviews from critics.

It was built on the Mesabi Iron Range near the city of Gilbert in St. Louis County. Elcor was its own unincorporated community before it was abandoned and was never a neighborhood proper of the city of Gilbert. Not rating a figure in the national census, the people of Elcor were only generally considered to be citizens of Gilbert. The area where Elcor was located was annexed by Gilbert when its existing city boundaries were expanded after 1969.\n\nIn November 1890, the seven Merritt brothers discovered ore near Mountain Iron, triggering an unparalleled iron rush to the Mesabi Range. The Elba mine was opened in 1897, and the town was platted under the direction of Don H. Bacon, president of the Minnesota Iron Company. A second nearby mine, the Corsica, was opened in 1901.  The community was first called \"Elba\" after the name of the first underground mine (the name \"Elcor\" was formed later by combining the first syllables of each mine's name). The Elba and Corsica mines were both leased by Pickands Mather and Company after the formation of the United States Steel Corporation. An influx of people of many ethnicities and many nations followed, and Elcor became a microcosm of U.S. immigration, mirroring the cultural assimilation of the time. At its peak around 1920, Elcor had two churches, a post office, a general store, a primary school, a railroad station, and its own law enforcement, and housed a population of nearly 1,000.\n\nElcor was a mining location, built by the mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the residents to vacate the property so that it could reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers, and bankruptcies. In 1993, the Inland Steel Company began stockpiling the overburden from what is now the Minorca Mine over Elcor's former location.", "title": "Elcor, Minnesota"}

The son of an appellate judge, Raht attended the University of Bonn, 1844-45, and then the University of Berlin, 1845-47, where he studied \"chemistry, mineralogy, etc. etc.\"R. E. Barclay, Ducktown Back in Raht's Time (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 1946), 186.  After the failed German revolution of 1848, Raht immigrated to the United States in 1850 and became a citizen in 1853.Duncan Maysilles, Ducktown Smoke: The Fight over One of the South's Greatest Environmental Disasters (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina, 2011), 32; Barclay, 186. Eventually three of his brothers also made their way to the United States, including the noted architect Edward E. Raht.\n\nRaht worked for short periods in Missouri, Dubuque, Iowa, and Wisconsin before taking charge of mining at Harpers Ferry, Leesburg, and Jamestown, Virginia, and Guilford County, North Carolina.Barclay, 187.  By 1854, he decided that the best opportunity to make his fortune lay in the copper mining industry near Ducktown, Tennessee, in the extreme southeastern corner of the state.  After a brief trip to Germany to marry Mithilde Dombois, Raht became \"captain\" of a mining operation.  Six years later he was chief of operations of all the mines and smelting works at Ducktown and had already purchased a farm and mule teams for copper hauling. He also engaged in what was to become his most profitable enterprise, running commissaries for the miners.Barclay, 189-91. In 1859 he bought a slave named Edom, who was sold with a mule team, but Raht soon freed him.  As his biographer has written, Raht was \"spirited, methodical, ambitious, honest...no less a stern taskmaster in his own behalf than he was a loyal employee of those in whose interests he served.\" Soon he was wealthy enough to lend money to his erstwhile employers.Barclay, 190-91.\n\nEarly in the Civil War, the Confederate government effectively confiscated the Ducktown mines.  Raht at first continued to operate them in an attempt to protect the investments of the owners in New York and New Orleans; but in 1863, after he was forced to purchase a Confederate army substitute and Federal troops destroyed the rail facilities and copper rolling mill in nearby Cleveland, Raht crossed the lines to live out the remainder of the war in Cincinnati, where there was a significant German community.Barclay, 87-96, 193.\n\nFollowing the war, Raht once again operated the Ducktown mines, personally financing much of the necessary repairs, but he maintained his home and office in Cleveland.  He founded the Cleveland National Bank and became manager of the Ocoee Turnpike and Plank Road Co., a transportation route needed to move copper to the nearest railroad. Raht had hidden some copper in the mines during the war, and he managed to produce more than a million pounds of copper during the first year of peace.Maysilles, 33 He also built new smelters using innovative methods developed by his brothers, including steam engines and diamond and compressed air drills.  Nevertheless, falling copper prices, lower quality ore, and the lack of a rail connection culminated in the temporary closing of the mines in 1878.Mining Hall of Fame; Maysilles, 33. When the railroad reached Ducktown in 1890, more than a decade after Raht's death, the mines were reopened. As the local mining industry was dying, shareholders of the United Consolidated Mining Company unsuccessfully sued Raht believing that his great wealth must have been created from their loss.Barclay, 170-84. \"The truth was much simpler.  He made his fortune legally by running a commissary business to supply food and sundries to the miners, and then by making shrewd investments of his profits throughout Ducktown and eastern Tennessee.\"Maysilles, 35.\n\nRaht and his wife had twelve children, six sons and two daughters surviving to maturity. Raht made numerous donations to charitable causes, especially churches and schools. Officially a Republican, he was \"more interested in politics as a science of attaining desired ends than in politics as the term is more commonly understood.\"Barclay, 229, 244. Though a nominal Lutheran, he was not a church goer.Barclay, 243. A lover of the table, Raht's \"voracious appetite transformed his stocky and powerful figure into one of commanding rotundity.\"  He died suddenly of a heart attack on August 15, 1879.Barclay, 247.  Two months earlier he had boasted in a letter of his good health and expressed concern about the poor health of his brother, August, who survived him by 38 years.

Third, the area experienced several snowfalls in March 2013 after an extreme dry period between November 2012 to February 2013, and the infiltration of water from the melted snow decreased the stability of the slope.

Their men were all mine workers employed in illegal stone quarries that have mushroomed over the past 10 years across the state thanks to record demand for sandstone, marble and other stones as people across the country built homes, offices and malls.\n\nThe film is a hitchhiker\u2019s journey through the labyrinthine universe of Democracy, as it exists in its lowest unit level \u2013 the Indian village.

It contains large phenocrysts (megacrysts) of orthoclase and in many places, rounded bipyramids of quartz. These phenocrysts are surrounded by a porphyritic matrix of grains of plagioclase, quartz, orthoclase, and abundant biotite and a bluish-gray aphanitic matrix. This quartz monzonite porphyry, which includes the former McNuly rhyolite, was formerly correlated with the Lincoln porphyry based on similarity of appearance.

Anthracite coal is a natural mineral with a high carbon and energy content that gives off light and heat (produced energy) when burned, making it useful as a fuel. It was possibly first used in Pennsylvania as a fuel in 1769, but its real history begins with a documented discovery near Summit Hill and the founding of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company in 1792 to sporadically send expeditions to the wilderness atop Pisgah Ridge to mine the deposits, mostly with notable lack of great success, over the next 22 years. The owners of this company were absentee management\u2014reliant on teams of workers sent under a foreman to fell timber to build so called 'Arks' (high-sided punts), then mine coal around nine miles (today's Summit Hill) from the right bank Lehigh (the Lehigh & Susquehanna Turnpike terminus at Mauch Chunk), then trek with mule loads to fill the boats for the trip down the rapid strewn Lehigh River,(Brenckman, p.\u00a0595-597) and then more than  to Philadelphia docks on the unimproved often log choked (Bartholomew, p.\u00a04\u20135) Delaware River.(Bartholomew, p.\u00a04)\n\nAbout 1790 the nation's first energy crisis became evident even in smaller towns\u2014the forests needed for charcoal for smelting and other manufacturing, and stands of wood for heating fire wood were quickly vanishing, farther and farther from population centers. Transport of wood or an alternative fuel became very important to people, and bituminous was cheaper to import from England than 'chancy, unreliable' anthracite was to buy in Philadelphia. Suffering through British navy blockades through during the war, industrialist Josiah White set his mill supervisors the task of experimenting with Anthracite to get to ignite  and burn in a useful way.\n\nIn 1813, the first mining actually in the Lehigh Valley was begun at Beaver Meadows, however, because of the various struggles getting it the  to Philadelphia and because it is far more difficult to ignite Anthracite with its sporadic and unreliable supply did not come to be generally used regularly until after the War of 1812 and Hazard and White showed the way.  The developments of the canal and then railroad system made transporting the anthracite exponentially easier, and by the 1860s anthracite coal was regularly supplying urban centers like Philadelphia and New York City and was helping to fuel the American Industrial Revolution.", "title": "History of anthracite coal mining in Pennsylvania"}

The union was created in the western United States, and eventually expanded throughout the United States and Canada.\nThe union was known for its militant measures in dealing with opposing forces, and firm in its opposition to the politics that existed in the country during the Cold War. The Mine Mill union was very active politically from the 1930s to the 1960s, when it merged with the United Steelworkers. Ironically, the principles that the union supported in the workplace often clashed with popular ideology found in the home and community. The philosophies of the union often mirrored communism, and some of its leaders were believed to be members of the Communist Party.\nJust as the nation struggled with the idea of communism in the 1920s, unions were faced with philosophical treatment of those in positions of power. Reid Robinson, IUMMSW president appointed communists to union positions of authority. Anticommunist members called for Robinson to resign in 1947, but were aggravated when they learned that Maurice Travis, a communist, would succeed him. Travis eventually left the party to comply with specifications of the Taft-Hartley Act, but his activities were heavily scrutinized by Senator Joseph McCarthy and his investigators.\nBy the 1950s, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers had achieved establishment of approximately 300 locals, with about 37,000 total members in the United States and Canada. Although all locals had some common goals, such as establishing ways to ensure that all workers are treated fairly, each local dealt with issues specific to that group.", "title": "International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers"}

{"text": "The Soledad Canyon Sand and Gravel Mining Project is the legal name of a mining project in Northern Los Angeles County east of the City of Santa Clarita, California, United States. First mined in 1921, the property was later mined by Curtis Sand and Gravel from the early 1960s until 1989, when, as a result of a legal settlement, the Bureau of Land Management put two 10-year leases to mine sand and gravel from the site out to competitive bid. The contracts were awarded to Transit Mixed Concrete, which eventually sold them to Cemex Corporation.\n\nThe former operator, Curtis Sand & Gravel, sued in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn the contracts. After Curtis' legal options had been exhausted, the City of Santa Clarita started questioning the validity of Transit Mixed's contracts as part of a public relations campaign to cause the mining contracts to be cancelled. The BLM approved the project in 2000 by issuing a Record of Decision after a review process which lasted over 10 years. The city challenged the approval in court, alleging that the project would spoil air quality, increase traffic on the 14 Freeway and town roads and would threaten endangered fish and wildlife species. Eventually, Cemex, with the United States (Bureau of Land Management) intervening, successfully sued the County of Los Angeles for unreasonable delays. The result was a \"consent decree\" or settlement enjoining the county from further interference, and requiring the county to issue a permit and certify the EIR for the federally-approved project in 2004. A 2008 United States District Court decision awarded Cemex attorney fees of $524,476.60 from the City of Santa Clarita. In the decision, Judge A. Howard Matz responded to the City's claim that its action against decertifying the CEQA decision on the Soledad Canyon Sand and Gravel Mining Project constituted \"a CEQA Action (sic) as permitted under California law\" by pointing out that \"every party seeking to enforce CEQA or any comparable environmental statute - - indeed, all statutes, even anti-discrimination laws - - has the duty to comply with applicable professional and judicial requirements.

The first Bill, sponsored in the Senate by Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and co-sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is S.771, the Soledad Canyon Settlement Act from 2013. S.771 and a subsequent piece of legislation sought to engage Congress to direct the Bureau of Land Management to sell vacant land in the desert near Victorville, California, the proceeds of which would go to Cemex Corporation to buy out their interest in mining Soledad Canyon. A subsequent bill (S. 2938http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113s2938is/content-detail.html), with its House version successfully passed, was held up in the Senate for environmental reasons by Martin Heinrich, Democratic senator from New Mexico.http://scvnews.com/2014/12/15/holdout-senator-says-cemex-bill-sets-bad-precedent/ Heinrich objected to selling public lands as a budget offset to pay for the buyout of the mining contracts.\n\nOn August 28, 2015 the BLM issued a cancellation of the contracts,https://www.scribd.com/doc/290759194/BLM-Decision-To-Rescind-Mining-Contracts-In-Soledad-Canyon-8-15-15 and the decision is currently being appealed by CEMEX.

{"text": "The South Yorkshire Miners' Association (SYMA) was an early British trade union representing coal miners in the southern West Riding of Yorkshire and northern Derbyshire.\n\nThe union was founded in 1858 at the White Bear Inn in Barnsley in response to a planned wage cut, with Richard Mitchell appointed a few weeks later as its secretary.  Following the formation of the union, colliery owners agreed not to impose cuts, but at the Oaks Colliery, the owner refused to re-employ union members.  Following a lengthy strike, they were taken back, although they had to draw lots with blackleg workers for the seams of coal they had been working.  Several more disputes took place over the next few years, the most important in 1859 at Wharncliffe Silkstone Colliery, where workers succeeded in keeping an elected checkweighman, John Normansell.\n\nThe union took part in national conferences of miners in Leeds and Ashton-under-Lyne in 1858 and 1859, but these did not lead to any lasting national union.  They did agree to send a delegation to Parliament, with Mitchell as its secretary, which succeeded in getting the Mines Regulation Act 1860 passed.  This permitted all miners to demand that they elect a checkweighman, although in practice this right was rarely recognised by employers.  The Miners' National Association was finally established in 1863, with the strong support of the SYMA, and with Mitchell as its secretary.\n\nIn 1864, miners at the Oaks went on strike, asking for a month's advance of wages.  This was without the sanction of the union and they did not initially receive any union benefits.  However, many other colliery owners feared that the demand would spread, and pre-empted this by locking out miners across the district.  This lasted for nineteen weeks, during which Normansell took the lead in maintaining solidarity.  At this point, the owners reopened their mines, re-employing the miners under their former pay and conditions, although the Oaks held out until December.  This action was considered a success for the union, and membership rose to 2,279.\n\nThe SYMA was reorganised under the new leadership of Normansell, introducing standard procedures across all branches, and successfully promoting the election of checkweighmen across the district.  With his assistant Philip Casey, they rebuilt membership to over 20,000, and began running annual South Yorkshire Miners' Galas.Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, p.256  The union was also a prominent founder of the UK Association of Organised Trades, loaning it money on several occasions.  Financial aid was frequently sent to other miners' unions involved in disputes, and local trade unions in other industries.  In 1874, new offices were opened in Barnsley.\n\nIn 1860, miners at Brightside in Sheffield formed a union and, in November, joined the SYMA, as its first branch in the city.  However, they were then victimised by their employer and the branch collapsed.  It was only re-established in 1866, when miners in Tinsley also joined, the union prioritising bringing their working conditions up to the standards enjoyed in the rest of the district.  This was fiercely resisted by some mineowners, and led to an eighteen-month strike in 1869/70 which spread across the district, with the union successful at some pits but entirely defeated at others.\n\nThe union long co-operated with the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Miners' Association, but this was largely defeated by 1868.  As a result, the SYMA began building up branches in north Derbyshire.  However, membership remained low in the district, and the SYMA leadership had little time to deal with disputes there, so little activity took place.  In 1880, lodges in the county split away to form the new Derbyshire Miners' Association.\n\nWages increased rapidly during the early 1870s, but from 1874 coal prices began falling, and wages were cut.  Normansell was criticised by some miners for not doing more to oppose this, and resigned in 1875 in protest.  He was replaced by John Frith, who invested much of the SYMA's capital in the Shirland Colliery, but lost this when the pit went into liquidation in 1877.  Soon after, most of its members in Derbyshire left to form the Derbyshire Miners' Association.  The SYMA began negotiating a merger with the West Yorkshire Miners' Association; this was completed in 1881, forming the new Yorkshire Miners' Association.Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.I, p.126", "title": "South Yorkshire Miners' Association"}

The mine was sold two more times: to Magnum Coal in 2005 and to Patriot Coal in 2008. Patriot Coal subsequently went bankrupt in 2015, and the Hobet site was passed into a Virginia-based conservation firm who continued to mine the land while reclaiming and planting trees to offset carbon emissions for other companies.\nThe Hobet 21 Coal Mine site is currently defunct and in 2016, former West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin proposed developing the environmentally degraded former coal field.

{"text": "The Bolivian tin belt () is a mineral-rich region in the Cordillera Oriental of Bolivia. Being a metallogenetic province the Bolivian tin belt is rich in tin, tungsten, silver and base metals. The Bolivian tin belt follows the same bend as the Bolivian orocline. The mineralizations of the belt were formed episodically beginning in the Triassic and with the youngest known mineralizations dating to the Miocene. \nThe mineral enrichment is a result of fluids expelled from peraluminous magmas. Peraluminous magmas in turn results from the partial melting (anatexis) of metasedimentary rock and gneiss in the continental crust. Analysis of trace elements in the igneous rocks formed by this magma suggests that some of its material derives from melting of a pelitic rock of Lower Paleozoic age. Besides crustal components magmas did also involved sources in the mantle. The formation of these magmas is thus a form of crustal recycling.  \n\nPeraluminous magmas are rare in the Andes but more common in collisional orogens such the Himalayas. From this it is inferred that the Andean orogeny in Bolivia should have features in common with collisional orogens. This in turn might be related to particularities in  the interaction of the South American Plate and the Nazca Plate during the Andean orogeny which led to collision-like events in the Cenozoic at the latitudes of Bolivia.

Men, women and children perished in explosions, roof falls, floods and haulage accidents. The Lancashire Coalfield, the seventh largest producer of coal in the 1870s, often had the highest accident figures. William Pickard, the miners' agent, championed the formation of the Lancashire and Cheshire Miners' Permanent Relief Society in 1872 after a spate of disasters that caused great distress and hardship,leaving widows and families destitute.\n\nMost fatalities were caused by firedamp, some caused by the miners who took the tops off the safety lamps that were designed to protect them because of the poor light they gave out. Some mineowners turned a blind eye to the use of candles in even the gassiest coal seams.\n\nTo regulate working conditions, the government passed Acts of Parliament: the 1842 Act prohibited the employment of females and boys under 10 years old  and appointed a single inspector, but inspections were few and breaches were common. Acts passed in subsequent years led to the appointment of more inspectors and increased their powers to regulate how mines were operated and the working conditions and welfare of the miners.\n\nAfter disasters the first rescuers were colliery managers and volunteer colleagues who descended into the pits to look for signs of life, rescue the injured, seal off underground fires and recover bodies while working in dangerous conditions sometimes at great cost to themselves. Apart from safety lamps to detect gases, they had no special equipment. They were the predecessors of the mines rescue teams. Mines rescue stations were recommended in a Royal Commission in 1886 but were not compulsory until after the Coal Mines Act 1911 was passed. In 1906 a committee of the Lancashire and Cheshire Coal Owners Association decided to provide a mines rescue station at Howe Bridge. Its trained rescuers were present at the Maypole and Pretoria Pit disasters. They also trained teams of men in pits throughout the coalfield.

He was best known for his study and cultivation of aloe on his extensive estate, which was donated to the state upon his death and became a national park.\n\nChristian initially attempted to grow imported European plants on his farm, but these tree species, which tend to be conifers, were not well-suited to the region's heat, dryness, and low altitude. In 1916, after it proved impossible to remove an unsightly rock from a spacious lawn in front of the house, Christian took an Aloe cameronii from a nearby hill and planted it in front of the stone. He was very impressed when the aloe flowered the next year despite not having been watered, and decided to focus thereafter on aloes rather than imported trees.

Precious metals as gold, and silver, platinum, nickel and coltan are located in different areas throughout the country.

{"text": "The Warwickshire Miners' Association was a trade union representing coal miners in the Warwickshire area of England.\n\nIn 1885, the Newdegate family leased their Warwickshire coal mine to a Sheffield-based company, who attempted to cut costs by reducing miners' wages.  This prompted miners to strike, and afterwards they formed the Warwickshire and Stafford Miners' Trade Union, which was later renamed as the \"Warwickshire Miners' Association\".  The union's first secretary was William Johnson, who later became a local Member of Parliament.\n\nIn 1889, the union was a founder constituent of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB).  In about 1892, it affiliated to the Midland Counties Miners' Federation, with Johnson becoming treasurer of the federation.  The MFGB voted to affiliate to the Labour Party in 1909, but Johnson and the Warwickshire Miners refused to follow suit.  This led to a series of disputes, and in 1912 a group of members including Walter John French split away to form the rival North Warwickshire Miners' Association.  George Henry Jones became secretary of the North Warwickshire Miners, but moved to the Warwickshire Miners in 1919, and two years later was able to persuade the North Warwickshire Miners to rejoin the original union.\n\nAt its peak, the union had 11,000 members, in 25 branches.\n\nThe MFGB became the National Union of Mineworkers in 1944, and the Warwickshire Miners' Association became its Warwickshire District (Midlands Area), with less autonomy than before.", "title": "Warwickshire Miners' Association"}

{"text": "Sulitjelma Mines () was a Norwegian mining company that extracted copper, pyrite, and zinc at Sulitjelma in the municipality of Fauske, Norway. Operations started with a test mine in 1887. From 1891 to 1933, the business was registered as a Swedish company called Sulitelma Aktiebolags Gruber. From 1933 to 1983, it was registered as a Norwegian company called A/S Sulitjelma Gruber, and from 1983 until it was shut down in 1991 the company was state-owned and was named Sulitjelma Bergverk AS.\n\nChalcopyrite was found by the Sami Mons Andreas Petersen around 1858, but due to the very remote location of the place there was skepticism that the deposits could be commercially viable. It was only when the Swedish industrialist and consul Nils Persson gained interest in the ore deposits in 1886 that progress was made in developing mining in Sulitelma. The company Sulitelma Aktiebolags Gruber was founded in 1891. That same year, the narrow-gauge Sulitjelma Line was built. Until 1956, copper and semi-finished products were transported by train and steamship to the port at Finneid. Transport was an expensive part of the operations throughout the history of the mining company.\n\nSeveral technical innovations and inventions were made at Sulitjelma, including the Knudsen process and some of the world's first electric copper smelters. Later in the history of the works many other improvements were made, especially in concentrating ore and smelting. In the early 1900s, Sulitjelma Mines was the second-largest industrial company in Norway.\n\nSulitjelma was initially an isolated mountain village inhabited by pioneer settlers, but the population increased rapidly in pace with mining, from about 50 around 1890 to almost 3,000 in 1910. The living conditions for the workers were very primitive, and the work conditions were difficult and hazardous to health. The class differences between workers, foremen, and officials were noticeable. After the large-scale assembly on the ice of Long Lake (Langvatnet) on January 13, 1907, when the first labor association was founded, conditions gradually improved.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Sulitjelma Mines was considered to be so important for the German war industry that production had to be maintained at all costs. Although the Gestapo knew that employees were engaged in illegal activities, they failed to intervene because they feared that the arrest of key personnel would impact production.\n\nThe upswing after the Second World War turned to uncertainty when copper prices fell sharply in 1975. The weakened profitability that followed led to economizing operations and dismissals. Then there was also a need for large investments in the old plant. Among other things, pollution from the smelting hut had become an increasing problem that could only be solved with a costly treatment plant. Remedial measures were taken, but these were subsequently considered unsuccessful. Mining ceased in 1991.\n\nIn its approximately 100 years of operation, six million tons of metal and sulfur were extracted. Most of this was sulfur. The remainder was 0.47 million tons of copper, 215 tons of zinc, 282 tons of silver, and 3.7 tons of gold.", "title": "Sulitjelma Mines"}

{"text": "The West Bromwich Miners' Association was a trade union representing coal miners in southern Staffordshire and eastern Worcestershire, in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe union brought together small miners' unions based in Bradley, Coseley, Oldbury, Tipton and West Bromwich, the oldest of which had been founded in either 1860 or 1863.  It was established in 1869 as the West Bromwich, Oldbury, Tipton, Coseley and Bradley Amalgamated Association of Miners, linked with the new, national, Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM), but was usually known by the shorter title of the \"West Bromwich Miners' Association\".  During this period, George Henry Rowlinson served twice as president of the union.\n\nThe union's membership peaked at 3,105 in 1875, but it only just survived the collapse of the national AAM, membership falling to only 515 in 1881.  An 1884 strike involving miners in many of the unions based in the West Midlands brought the union close to collapse.  However, Samuel Henry Whitehouse became the union's agent, and in 1886 it became a founder constituent of the Midland Counties Miners' Federation, with Whitehouse becoming the federation's first secretary.  The union saw a resurgence in membership, but Whitehouse left in 1888 and was replaced by Henry Rust, who withdrew the union from the federation, and also kept it outside the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB).  Initially this strategy proved successful, membership reaching 2,218 again by 1892, but by 1898 it was struggling.  The union was renamed as the South Staffordshire and East Worcestershire Amalgamated Association of Miners, and Thomas Mansell took over as secretary.  In 1899, he brought the union back into the Midland Federation, and through it, also into membership of the MFGB.  Membership peaked during World War I, hitting 4,210 in 1915, but then fell rapidly, declining to 1,031 in 1920.", "title": "West Bromwich Miners' Association"}
{"text": "The National Federation of Colliery Officials was a trade union representing colliery workers in the United Kingdom who were not involved in manual labour.\n\nThe federation was established in December 1919 by local unions of colliery officials, with the most important being the Northern Colliery Officials' Mutual Association, founded in 1914, and the Lancashire and Cheshire Colliery Officials' Association.  It soon had six smaller affiliates, including Consett, the Forest of Dean Colliery Examiners', Overmen, and Shot Firers' Association, the Midland Mining Officials' Association, the Somerset Colliery Officials' Association, and Yorkshire.\n\nThe federation received recognition from colliery owners in 1920, and quickly negotiated a national agreement on pay and conditions for colliery officials and clerks.  By 1936, the membership of the federation was described as \"surveyors, under-managers, overmen, master wastemen, electricians and engineers, surface foremen, screening plant foremen, and clerks\".  About three-quarters of its members were based in Durham and Northumberland, with the third-largest district being Lancashire, which housed its office, in Bolton.\n\nBy the 1940s, the federation was known as the National Federation of Colliery Officials and Staffs, reflecting its broader membership, and in 1945 it affiliated to the Trades Union Congress (TUC), with a membership of 8,183, of whom 120 were women.\n\nWhen the mining industry was nationalised, in 1947, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) sought to unite all workers in the industry.  Members of the federation voted heavily in favour of joining the NUM, and did so on 1 January 1947, becoming the Colliery Officials and Staffs Area (COSA).  Two smaller, independent unions of colliery officials voted against joining the NUM.  The TUC brokered a deal whereby national level clerical staff would transfer to the Clerical and Administrative Workers' Union, and divisional level clerical staff to the Transport and General Workers' Union, and this satisfied the smaller unions so that they dissolved, dividing their members between the new NUM section and the two other unions.\n\nAs employment in the mining industry declined, COSA became an increasingly important section of the NUM; by 1979, it had 18,980 members out of a total NUM membership of around 250,000.  The section survives, and as of 2017, had 24 members.", "title": "National Federation of Colliery Officials"}
{"text": "The Cambrian Miners' Association, also known as the Rhondda District Miners' Association, was an early trade union representing coal miners in the Rhondda Valley, in Wales.\n\nThe Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM) began recruiting members in the Rhondda Valley in 1870, William Brown chairing a recruitment meeting.  Members in the valley were part of a largely successful strike in 1871, and early in 1872 they were placed in their own, Rhondda District.  Rhondda District secretary, Williams Davies, disappeared partway through a lock out in 1875, and the AAM collapsed soon afterwards.  The Rhondda District, like the other surviving Welsh districts, instead joined the Miners' National Union, and was represented by Henry Rowlands at a conference of its Monmouthshire and South Wales Council, in 1876.\n\nMabon had been the AAM's last agent in South Wales, and he was elected as president of a reformed AAM in 1877.  He relocated to the Rhondda in 1877.  That year, the Cambrian Miners' Association split, the minority becoming the Rhondda House Coal Miners' Association, and the majority becoming the Rhondda Steam Coal Miners' Association, choosing Mabon as its agent..\n\nUnder Mabon's leadership, the union grew rapidly, and his success led to the creation of numerous other unions of coal miners in South Wales.  The Cambrian Miners remained the largest of these unions, membership reaching 14,000 by 1885, although this fell to 10,000 by 1893.  Retention was good partly because the union worked with colliery clerks to deduct subscriptions directly from members' wages.\n\nThe union was led by an executive committee, which alone held the ability to order industrial action and determine strike pay.  However, a monthly meeting of delegates from each mine made other policy decisions.  It supported the \"sliding scale\", whereby wages rose and fell in line with the export price of coal, agreed through a joint committee with employers.  The Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) opposed this practice, so the Cambrian Miners did not affiliate to the MFGB.\n\nMabon was elected as the Member of Parliament for Rhondda at the 1885 UK general election, with the sponsorship of the union.  In 1896, the union's secretary, William Evans, was also approved as a candidate, but he ultimately did not stand for election.  The union's other leading figure was its treasurer, Thomas Davies, owner of a pub in Ton Pentre.\n\nIn 1892, the union joined a committee, which for the first time brought together those Welsh coal-mining unions which supported the sliding scale, and those which did not, and in 1893 Mabon was appointed as its president.  Subsequently, the employers ended the sliding scale in response to the Welsh coal strike of 1898.  This led the Cambrian Miners to merge with the other local unions, forming the South Wales Miners' Federation.

This provided the spur for the formation of the Monmouthshire Miners' Association, in January 1888, which affiliated to the MNU.\n\nUnlike the Cambrian Miners' Association, the Monmouthshire Miners opposed the sliding scale of wages, whereby payments varied in accordance with the export price of coal.  In 1889, the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) was established at a conference in Newport.
