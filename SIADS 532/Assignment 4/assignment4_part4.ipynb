    "When looking back at the year 2020, perhaps no one would forget the then rampant coronavirus disease, COVID-19, which had caused 14,366 deaths worldwide as of March 22, 2020. [One](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2008-3) of the early papers published immediately after the outbreak claims that the coronavirus found in [humans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) is highly (96%) similar in genes to a particular coronavirus found in [bats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/1802633852). Based on our previous (perhaps limited) exposure to biology, we know that a gene is a *sequence* of nucleotides that can be expressed in terms of four nucleobases, `A`, `T`, `G` and `C`. To identify similar genes can actually be cast as a *sequence alignment* problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will try to *roughly* verify the claim in the paper by calculating an \"alignment score\" between the human-hosted coronavirus genes and the bat-hosted coronavirus genes. "
