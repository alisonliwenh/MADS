3,Data mining," datum mining   be the process of discover pattern in large data set involve method at the intersection of machine learning , statistic , and database system . datum mining be an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistic with an overall goal to extract information ( with intelligent method ) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use . datum mining be the analysis step of the "" knowledge discovery in database "" process , or kdd . aside from the raw analysis step , it also involve database and data management aspect , datum pre - processing , model and inference consideration , interestingness metric , complexity consideration , post - processing of discover structure , visualization , and online updating . the difference between datum analysis and datum mining be that datum analysis be use to test model and hypothesis on the dataset , e.g. , analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign , regardless of the amount of datum ; in contrast , datum mining use machine - learning and statistical model to uncover clandestine or hide pattern in a large volume of datum . olson , d. l. ( 2007 ) . datum mining in business service . service business , 1(3 ) , 181 - 193 . doi:10.1007/s11628 - 006 - 0014 - 7 

 the term "" datum mining "" be in fact a misnomer , because the goal be the extraction of pattern and knowledge from large amount of datum , not the extraction ( mining ) of datum itself . It also be a buzzwordokairp 2005 fall conference , arizona state university   and be frequently apply to any form of large - scale datum or information processing ( collection , extraction , warehousing , analysis , and statistic ) as well as any application of computer decision support system , include artificial intelligence ( e.g. , machine learning ) and business intelligence . the book data mining : practical machine learning tool and technique with java ( which cover mostly machine learning material ) be originally to be name just practical machine learning , and the term datum mining be only add for marketing reason . often the more general term ( large scale ) data analysis and analytic – or , when refer to actual method , artificial intelligence and machine learning – be more appropriate . 

 the actual data mining task be the semi - automatic or automatic analysis of large quantity of datum to extract previously unknown , interesting pattern such as group of datum record ( cluster analysis ) , unusual record ( anomaly detection ) , and dependency ( association rule mining , sequential pattern mining ) . this usually involve use database technique such as spatial index . these pattern can then be see as a kind of summary of the input datum , and may be use in further analysis or , for example , in machine learning and predictive analytic . for example , the datum mining step may identify multiple group in the datum , which can then be use to obtain more accurate prediction result by a decision support system . neither the datum collection , datum preparation , nor result interpretation and reporting be part of the datum mining step , but do belong to the overall kdd process as additional step . 

 the related term datum dredging , datum fishing , and datum snoop refer to the use of datum mining method to sample part of a large population datum set that be ( or may be ) too small for reliable statistical inference to be make about the validity of any pattern discover . these method can , however , be use in create new hypothesis to test against the large data population .

10,Pattern recognition," pattern recognition be the automate recognition of pattern and regularity in datum . pattern recognition be closely related to artificial intelligence and machine learning , 
  together with application such as datum mining and knowledge discovery in database ( kdd ) , and be often use interchangeably with these term . however , these be distinguished : machine learning be one approach to pattern recognition , while other approach include hand - craft ( not learn ) rule or heuristic ; and pattern recognition be one approach to artificial intelligence , while other approach include symbolic artificial intelligence . a modern definition of pattern recognition be : 

 this article focus on machine learn approach to pattern recognition . pattern recognition system be in many case train from label "" training "" datum ( supervised learning ) , but when no label datum be available other algorithm can be use to discover previously unknown pattern ( unsupervised learning ) . machine learning be the common term for supervised learning method and originate from artificial intelligence , whereas kdd and datum mining have a large focus on unsupervised method and strong connection to business use . pattern recognition have its origin in engineering , and the term be popular in the context of computer vision : a lead computer vision conference be name conference on computer vision and pattern recognition . in pattern recognition , there may be a high interest to formalize , explain and visualize the pattern , while machine learn traditionally focus on maximize the recognition rate . yet , all of these domain have evolve substantially from their root in artificial intelligence , engineering and statistic , and they have become increasingly similar by integrate development and idea from each other . 

 in machine learning , pattern recognition be the assignment of a label to a give input value . in statistic , discriminant analysis be introduce for this same purpose in 1936 . an example of pattern recognition be classification , which attempt to assign each input value to one of a give set of class ( for example , determine whether a give email be "" spam "" or "" non - spam "" ) . however , pattern recognition be a more general problem that encompass other type of output as well . other example be regression , which assign a real - value output to each input ; sequence labeling , which assign a class to each member of a sequence of value ( for example , part of speech tagging , which assign a part of speech to each word in an input sentence ) ; and parse , which assign a parse tree to an input sentence , describe the syntactic structure of the sentence . 

 pattern recognition algorithm generally aim to provide a reasonable answer for all possible input and to perform "" most likely "" matching of the input , take into account their statistical variation . this be oppose to pattern match algorithm , which look for exact match in the input with pre - exist pattern . a common example of a pattern - match algorithm be regular expression matching , which look for pattern of a give sort in textual datum and be include in the search capability of many text editor and word processor . in contrast to pattern recognition , pattern matching be not generally a type of machine learning , although pattern - match algorithm ( especially with fairly general , carefully tailor pattern ) can sometimes succeed in provide similar - quality output of the sort provide by pattern - recognition algorithm .

16,Dynamic time warping," in time series analysis , dynamic time warping ( dtw ) be one of the algorithm for measure similarity between two temporal sequence , which may vary in speed .   for instance , similarity in walking could be detect use dtw , even if one person be walk faster than the other , or if there be acceleration and deceleration during the course of an observation . dtw have be apply to temporal sequence of video , audio , and graphic datum -- indeed , any datum that can be turn into a linear sequence can be analyze with dtw . a well know application have be automatic speech recognition , to cope with different speaking speed . other application include speaker recognition and online signature recognition . also it be see that it can be use in partial shape matching application . 

 in general , dtw be a method that calculate an optimal match between two give sequence ( e.g. time series ) with certain restriction and rule : 
  every index from the first sequence must be match with one or more index from the other sequence , and vice versa 
  the first index from the first sequence must be match with the first index from the other sequence ( but it do not have to be its only match ) 
  the last index from the first sequence must be match with the last index from the other sequence ( but it do not have to be its only match ) 
  the mapping of the index from the first sequence to index from the other sequence must be monotonically increase , and vice versa , i.e. if j > i be index from the first sequence , then there must not be two index l > k in the other sequence , such that index i be match with index l and index j be match with index k , and vice versa 

 the optimal match be denote by the match that satisfy all the restriction and the rule and that have the minimal cost , where the cost be compute as the sum of absolute difference , for each match pair of index , between their value . 

 the sequence be "" warped "" non - linearly in the time dimension to determine a measure of their similarity independent of certain non - linear variation in the time dimension . this sequence alignment method be often use in time series classification . although dtw measure a distance - like quantity between two give sequence , it do not guarantee the triangle inequality to hold . 

 in addition to a similarity measure between the two sequence , a so call "" warp path "" be produce , by warp accord to this path the two signal may be align in time . the signal with an original set of point x(original ) , y(original ) be transform to x(warped ) , y(warped ) . this find application in genetic sequence and audio synchronisation . in a related technique sequence of vary speed may be average use this technique see the average sequence section .

28,Cluster analysis," cluster analysis or clustering be the task of group a set of object in such a way that object in the same group ( call a cluster ) be more similar ( in some sense ) to each other than to those in other group ( cluster ) . It be a main task of exploratory datum mining , and a common technique for statistical datum analysis , use in many field , include machine learning , pattern recognition , image analysis , information retrieval , bioinformatic , datum compression , and computer graphic . 

 cluster analysis itself be not one specific algorithm , but the general task to be solve . It can be achieve by various algorithm that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitute a cluster and how to efficiently find them . popular notion of cluster include group with small distance between cluster member , dense area of the data space , interval or particular statistical distribution . clustering can therefore be formulate as a multi - objective optimization problem . the appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter setting ( include parameter such as the distance function to use , a density threshold or the number of expect cluster ) depend on the individual datum set and intend use of the result . cluster analysis as such be not an automatic task , but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi - objective optimization that involve trial and failure . It be often necessary to modify datum preprocess and model parameter until the result achieve the desire property . 

 besides the term cluster , there be a number of term with similar meaning , include automatic classification , numerical taxonomy , botryology ( from greek βότρυς "" grape "" ) , typological analysis , and community detection . the subtle difference be often in the use of the result : while in datum mining , the result group be the matter of interest , in automatic classification the result discriminative power be of interest . 

 cluster analysis be originate in anthropology by driver and kroeber in 1932 and introduce to psychology by joseph zubin in 1938 and robert tryon in 1939 and famously use by cattell begin in 1943 for trait theory classification in personality psychology . ",data mining,Data mining

32,Confusion matrix," in the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification , a confusion matrix , also know as an error matrix , be a specific table layout that allow visualization of the performance of an algorithm , typically a supervised learn one ( in unsupervised learning it be usually call a match matrix ) .   each row of the matrix represent the instance in a predict class while each column represent the instance in an actual class ( or vice versa ) .   the name stem from the fact that it make it easy to see if the system be confuse two class ( i.e. commonly mislabel one as another ) . 

 It be a special kind of contingency table , with two dimension ( "" actual "" and "" predict "" ) , and identical set of "" class "" in both dimension ( each combination of dimension and class be a variable in the contingency table ) . ",data mining,Machine learning
33,Receiver operating characteristic," a receiver operate characteristic curve , or roc curve , be a graphical plot that illustrate the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold be varied . 

 the roc curve be create by plot the true positive rate ( tpr ) against the false positive rate ( fpr ) at various threshold setting . the true - positive rate be also know as sensitivity , recall or probability of detection in machine learning . the false - positive rate be also know as the fall - out or probability of false alarm and can be calculate as ( 1 − specificity ) . It can also be think of as a plot of the power as a function of the type i error of the decision rule ( when the performance be calculate from just a sample of the population , it can be think of as estimator of these quantity ) . the roc curve be thus the sensitivity as a function of fall - out . in general , if the probability distribution for both detection and false alarm be know , the roc curve can be generate by plot the cumulative distribution function ( area under the probability distribution from -\infty to the discrimination threshold ) of the detection probability in the y - axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false - alarm probability on the x - axis . 

 roc analysis provide tool to select possibly optimal model and to discard suboptimal one independently from ( and prior to specify ) the cost context or the class distribution . roc analysis be relate in a direct and natural way to cost / benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making . 

 the roc curve be first develop by electrical engineer and radar engineer during world war ii for detect enemy object in battlefield and be soon introduce to psychology to account for perceptual detection of stimulus . roc analysis since then have be use in medicine , radiology , biometric , forecasting of natural hazard , meteorology , model performance assessment , and other area for many decade and be increasingly use in machine learning and datum mining research . 

 the roc be also know as a relative operating characteristic curve , because it be a comparison of two operating characteristic ( tpr and fpr ) as the criterion change . swet , john a. ; signal detection theory and roc analysis in psychology and diagnostic : collect paper , lawrence erlbaum associates , mahwah , nj , 1996 ",data mining,Data mining

41,Temporal difference learning," temporal difference ( td ) learning refer to a class of model - free reinforcement learning method which learn by bootstrapp from the current estimate of the value function . these method sample from the environment , like monte carlo method , and perform update base on current estimate , like dynamic programming method . 

 while monte carlo method only adjust their estimate once the final outcome be know , td method adjust prediction to match later , more accurate , prediction about the future before the final outcome be know . ( a revise version be available on richard sutton 's publication page ) this be a form of bootstrapping , as illustrate with the follow example : 

 "" suppose you wish to predict the weather for saturday , and you have some model that predict saturday 's weather , give the weather of each day in the week . in the standard case , you would wait until saturday and then adjust all your model . however , when it be , for example , friday , you should have a pretty good idea of what the weather would be on saturday – and thus be able to change , say , saturday 's model before saturday arrive .

42,Generative model," in statistical classification , include machine learning , two main approach be call the generative approach and the discriminative approach . these compute classifier by different approach , differ in the degree of statistical modelling . terminology be inconsistent , but three major type can be distinguish , follow :* give an observable variable x and a target variable y , a generative model be a statistical model of the joint probability distribution on x    ×    y , p(x , y ) ; : "" generative classifier learn a model of the joint probability , p(x , y ) , of the input x and the label y , and make their prediction by use bayes rule to calculate p(y|x ) , and then pick the most likely label y. 
  a discriminative model be a model of the conditional probability of the target y , give an observation x , symbolically , p(y|x = x ) ; and 
  classifiers compute without use a probability model be also refer to loosely as "" discriminative "" . 
 the distinction between these last two class be not consistently make ; : "" this distinction between conditional learning and discriminative learning be not currently a well establish convention in the field . ""   refer to these three class as generative learning , conditional learning , and discriminative learning , but   only distinguish two class , call them generative classifier ( joint distribution ) and discriminative classifier ( conditional distribution or no distribution ) , not distinguish between the latter two class . : "" discriminative classifier model the posterior p(y|x ) directly , or learn a direct map from input x to the class label . "" analogously , a classifier base on a generative model be a generative classifier , while a classifier base on a discriminative model be a discriminative classifier , though this term also refer to classifier that be not base on a model . standard example of each , all of which be linear classifier , be : generative classifier : naive baye classifi and linear discriminant analysis ; discriminative model : logistic regression ; non - model classifier : perceptron and support vector machine . 

 in application to classification , one wish to go from an observation x to a label y ( or probability distribution on label ) . one can compute this directly , without use a probability distribution ( distribution - free classifier ) ; one can estimate the probability of a label give an observation , p(y|x = x ) ( discriminative model ) , and base classification on that ; or one can estimate the joint distribution p(x , y ) ( generative model ) , from that compute the conditional probability p(y|x = x ) , and then base classification on that . these be increasingly indirect , but increasingly probabilistic , allow more domain knowledge and probability theory to be apply . in practice different approach be use , depend on the particular problem , and hybrid can combine strength of multiple approach .

43,Q-learning," q - learning be a model - free reinforcement learning algorithm . the goal of q - learning be to learn a policy , which tell an agent what action to take under what circumstance . It do not require a model ( hence the connotation "" model - free "" ) of the environment , and it can handle problem with stochastic transition and reward , without require adaptation . 

 for any finite markov decision process ( fmdp ) , q - learning find a policy that be optimal in the sense that it maximize the expect value of the total reward over any and   all successive step , start from the current state . q - learning can identify an optimal action - selection policy for any give fmdp , give infinite exploration time and a partly - random policy .

46,Data dredging," datum dredging ( also datum fishing , datum snooping , datum butchery , and p - hacking ) be the misuse of datum analysis to find pattern in datum that can be present as statistically significant when in fact there be no real underlying effect . this be do by perform many statistical test on the datum and only pay attention to those that come back with significant result , instead of state a single hypothesis about an underlying effect before the analysis and then conduct a single test for it . 

 the process of datum dredging involve automatically test huge number of hypothesis about a single datum set by exhaustively search — perhaps for combination of variable that may show a correlation , and perhaps for group of case or observation that show difference in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable . 

 conventional test of statistical significance be base on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone be at work , and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusion of a certain type ( mistaken rejection of the null hypothesis ) .   this level of risk be call the significance . when large number of test be perform , some produce false result of this type , hence 5 % of randomly choose hypothesis turn out to be significant at the 5 % level , 1 % turn out to be significant at the 1 % significance level , and so on , by chance alone . when enough hypothesis be test , it be virtually certain that some will be statistically significant but misleading , since almost every datum set with any degree of randomness be likely to contain ( for example ) some spurious correlation . if they be not cautious , researcher use datum mining technique can be easily mislead by these result . 

 the multiple comparison hazard be common in datum dredging . moreover , subgroup be sometimes explore without alert the reader to the number of question at issue , which can lead to misinform conclusion .

49,OPeNDAP," opendap be an acronym for "" open - source project for a network data access protocol , "" an endeavor focus on enhance the retrieval of remote , structured datum through a web - base architecture and a discipline - neutral data access protocol ( dap ) . widely use , especially in earth science , the protocol be layer on http , and its current specification be dap4,dap4 specification though the previous dap2 version remain broadly use . develop and advanced ( openly and collaboratively ) by the non - profit   opendap , inc.,official website dap be intend to enable remote , selective datum - retrieval as an easily invoke web service . opendap , inc. also develop and maintain zero - cost ( reference ) implementation of the dap protocol in both server - side and client - side software . 
 "" opendap "" often be use in place of "" dap "" to denote the protocol but also may refer to an entire dap - base data - retrieval architecture . other dap - center architecture , such as threddsthredds and erddap , the noaa geo - ide uaf erddaperddap exhibit significant interoperability with one another as well as with system employ opendap 's own ( open - source ) server and software . 

 a dap client can be an ordinary browser or even a spreadsheet , though with limited functionality ( see opendap 's web page on available client software ) . more typically , dap client be : 
  data - analysis or data - visualization tool ( such as matlab , idl , panoply , grads , integrated data viewer , ferret and ncbrowsea graphical netcdf file browser ) which their author have adapt to enable dap - base data input ; 
  similarly adapt web application ( such as dapper data viewer , aka dchart)opendap software 
  similarly adapt end - user program ( in common language ) 

 regardless of their type , and whether develop commercially or by an end - user , client almost universally link to dap server through library that implement the dap2 or dap4 protocol in one language or another . opendap offer open - source library in c++ and java , but many client rely on community develop library such as pydap or , especially , the netcdf suite . develop and maintain by the unidata program at the ucar in multiple programming language , all netcdf library include embed capability for retrieve ( array - style ) datum from dap server . 

 a data - use client reference a data set by its url and request metadata or content by issue ( usually through an embed dap library ) an http request to a dap server . content request usually be precede by request for metadata describe the structure and other detail about the reference data set . with this information , the client may construct dap constraint expressionsdap constraint expression to retrieve specific content ( i.e. , subset ) from the source . opendap server offer various type of response , depend on the specific form of the client 's request , include xml , json , html and ascii . in response to request for content , opendap server can respond with multi - part mime document that include a binary portion with netcdf or dap - native encoding . ( these binary form offer compact mean to deliver large volume of content , and the dap - native form may even be stream if desire . ) 

 opendap 's software for build dap server ( on top of apache ) be dub hyrax and include adapter that facilitate serve a wide variety of source datum . dap server most frequently enable ( remote ) access to ( large ) hdf or netcdf file , but the source datum can exist in database or other format , include user - define one . when source datum be organize as file , dap retrieval enable , via subsetting , finer - grain access than do the ftp . furthermore , opendap server can aggregate subset from multiple file for delivery in a single retrieval . take together , subsetting , aggregation and streaming can yield substantial datum - access efficiency , even in the presence of slow network . 

 opendap and other dap server be use operationally in government agency , include nasa and noaa , for provide access to earth science datum , include satellite imagery and other high - volume information source . the dap data model embrace a comprehensive set of datum structure , include multidimensional array and nest sequence ( i.e. , record ) , complement by a correspondingly rich set of constraint expression . hence the opendap data - retrieval architecture have demonstrate utility across a broad range of scientific datum type , include datum generate via simulation and datum generate via observation ( whether remotely sense or measure in situ ) .

"" through build a mathematical model from input datum . 

 the datum use to build the final model usually come from multiple dataset . in particular , three datum set be commonly use in different stage of the creation of the model . 

 the model be initially fit on a training dataset , that be a set of example use to fit the parameter ( e.g. weight of connection between neuron in artificial neural network ) of the model . the model ( e.g. a neural net or a naive baye classifier ) be train on the training dataset use a supervised learning method ( e.g. gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent ) . in practice , the training dataset often consist of pair of an input vector ( or scalar ) and the correspond output vector ( or scalar ) , which be commonly denote as the target ( or label ) . the current model be run with the training dataset and produce a result , which be then compare with the target , for each input vector in the training dataset . base on the result of the comparison and the specific learning algorithm be use , the parameter of the model be adjust . the model fitting can include both variable selection and parameter estimation . 

 successively , the fit model be use to predict the response for the observation in a second dataset call the validation dataset . the validation dataset provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tune the model 's hyperparameter   ( e.g. the number of hide unit in a neural network ) . validation dataset can be use for regularization by early stopping : stop training when the error on the validation dataset increase , as this be a sign of overfitt to the training dataset . 
 this simple procedure be complicate in practice by the fact that the validation dataset 's error may fluctuate during training , produce multiple local minima . this complication have lead to the creation of many ad - hoc rule for decide when overfitt have truly begin . 

 finally , the test dataset be a dataset use to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset . if the datum in the test dataset have never be use in training ( for example in cross - validation ) , the test dataset be also call a holdout dataset .

  in k - nn classification , the output be a class membership . an object be classify by a plurality vote of its neighbor , with the object be assign to the class most common among its k near neighbor ( k be a positive integer , typically small ) . if k    =    1 , then the object be simply assign to the class of that single near neighbor . 

  in k - nn regression , the output be the property value for the object . this value be the average of the value of k near neighbor . 

 k - nn be a type of instance - base learning , or lazy learning , where the function be only approximate locally and all computation be defer until classification . the k - nn algorithm be among the simple of all machine learn algorithm . 

 both for classification and regression , a useful technique can be use to assign weight to the contribution of the neighbor , so that the near neighbor contribute more to the average than the more distant one . for example , a common weighting scheme consist in give each neighbor a weight of 1/d , where d be the distance to the neighbor . this scheme be a generalization of linear interpolation .

It be invent by ralphe wiggins and produce by the ryan corp , later information harvesting inc. , of cambridge , massachusetts .   ih seek to infer rule from set of datum .   It do this first by classify various input variable into one of a number of bin , thereby put some structure on the continuous variable in the input .   ih then proceed to generate rule , trade off generalization against memorization , that will infer the value of the prediction variable , possibly create many level of rule in the process .   It include strategy for check if overfitt take place and , if so , correct for it .   because of its strategy for correct for overfitt by consider more datum , and refine the rule base on that datum , ih may also be consider to be a form of machine learning . 

 the advantage of ih , as compare with other datum mining product of its time and even later , be that it provide a mechanism for find multiple rule that would classify the datum and determine , accord to set criterion , the good rule to use . ",data mining,Data mining and machine learning software

111,Anomaly detection," in datum mining , anomaly detection ( also outlier detection ) be the identification of rare item , event or observation which raise suspicion by differ significantly from the majority of the datum . typically the anomalous item will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud , a structural defect , medical problem or error in a text . anomaly be also refer to as outlier , novelty , noise , deviation and exception . 

 in particular , in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection , the interesting object be often not rare object , but unexpected burst in activity . this pattern do not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object , and many outlier detection method ( in particular unsupervised method ) will fail on such datum , unless it have be aggregate appropriately . instead , a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro cluster form by these pattern . 

 three broad category of anomaly detection technique exist . unsupervised anomaly detection technique detect anomaly in an unlabeled test datum set under the assumption that the majority of the instance in the datum set be normal by look for instance that seem to fit least to the remainder of the datum set . supervised anomaly detection technique require a data set that have be label as "" normal "" and "" abnormal "" and involve train a classifier ( the key difference to many other statistical classification problem be the inherent unbalanced nature of outlier detection ) . semi - supervised anomaly detection technique construct a model represent normal behavior from a give normal training datum set , and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generate by the learnt model .

112,Minimum redundancy feature selection," minimum redundancy feature selection be an algorithm frequently use in a method to accurately identify characteristic of gene and phenotype and narrow down their relevance and be usually describe in its pairing with relevant feature selection as minimum redundancy maximum relevance ( mrmr ) . 
 feature selection , one of the basic problem in pattern recognition and machine learning , identify subset of datum that be relevant to the parameter use and be normally call maximum relevance . these subset often contain material which be relevant but redundant and mrmr attempt to address this problem by remove those redundant subset . mrmr have a variety of application in many area such as cancer diagnosis and speech recognition . 

 feature can be select in many different way . one scheme be to select feature that correlate strong to the classification variable . this have be call maximum - relevance selection . many heuristic algorithm can be use , such as the sequential forward , backward , or float selection . 

 on the other hand feature can be select to be mutually far away from each other while still have "" high "" correlation to the classification variable . this scheme , term as minimum redundancy maximum relevance ( mrmr ) selection have be find to be more powerful than the maximum relevance selection . 

 as a special case , the "" correlation "" can be replace by the statistical dependency between variable . mutual information can be use to quantify the dependency . in this case , it be show that mrmr be an approximation to maximize the dependency between the joint distribution of the select feature and the classification variable .

121,Probability matching," probability matching be a decision strategy in which prediction of class membership be proportional to the class base rate .   thus , if in the training set positive example be observe 60 % of the time , and negative example be observe 40 % of the time , then the observer use a probability - match strategy will predict ( for unlabeled example ) a class label of "" positive "" on 60 % of instance , and a class label of "" negative "" on 40 % of instance .  

 the optimal bayesian decision strategy ( to maximize the number of correct prediction , see ) in such a case be to always predict "" positive "" ( i.e. , predict the majority category in the absence of other information ) , which have 60 % chance of win rather than match which have 52 % of win   ( where p be the probability of positive realization , the result of matching would be p^2+(1-p)^2 , here .6 \time .6 + .4 \time .4 ) .   the probability - match strategy be of psychological interest because it be frequently employ by human subject in decision and classification study ( where it may be relate to thompson sampling ) . 

 the only case when probability matching will yield same result as bayesian decision strategy mention above be when all class base rate be the same . so , if in the training set positive example be observe 50 % of the time , then the bayesian strategy would yield 50 % accuracy ( 1 × .5 ) , just as probability matching ( .5 ×.5 + .5 × .5 ) .

133,Matthews correlation coefficient," the matthews correlation coefficient be use in machine learn as a measure of the quality of binary ( two - class ) classification , introduce by biochemist brian w. matthews in 1975 . It take into account true and false positive and negative and be generally regard as a balanced measure which can be use even if the class be of very different size . the mcc be in essence a correlation coefficient between the observed and predict binary classification ; it return a value between −1 and + 1 . a coefficient of + 1 represent a perfect prediction , 0 no good than random prediction and −1 indicate total disagreement between prediction and observation . the statistic be also know as the phi coefficient . mcc be relate to the chi - square statistic for a 2×2 contingency table 
  |\text{mcc}| = \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2}{n } } 

 where n be the total number of observation . 

 while there be no perfect way of describe the confusion matrix of true and false positive and negative by a single number , the matthews correlation coefficient be generally regard as be one of the good such measure . other measure , such as the proportion of correct prediction ( also term accuracy ) , be not useful when the two class be of very different size . for example , assign every object to the large set achieve a high proportion of correct prediction , but be not generally a useful classification . 

 the mcc can be calculate directly from the confusion matrix use the formula : 

 
 \text{mcc } = \frac { \mathit{tp } \time \mathit{tn } - \mathit{fp } \tim \mathit{fn } } { \sqrt { ( \mathit{tp } + \mathit{fp } ) ( \mathit{tp } + \mathit{fn } ) ( \mathit{tn } + \mathit{fp } ) ( \mathit{tn } + \mathit{fn } ) } } 


 in this equation , tp be the number of true positive , tn the number of true negative , fp the number of false positive and fn the number of false negative . if any of the four sum in the denominator be zero , the denominator can be arbitrarily set to one ; this result in a matthews correlation coefficient of zero , which can be show to be the correct limit value . 

 the mcc can be calculate with the formula : 
 
 \text{mcc } = \sqrt{\mathit{ppv } \time \mathit{tpr } \time \mathit{tnr } \time \mathit{npv } } 
 -\sqrt{\mathit{fdr } \time \mathit{fnr } \tim \mathit{fpr } \time \mathit{for } } 

 use the positive predictive value , the true positive rate , the true negative rate , the negative predictive value , the false discovery rate , the false negative rate , the false positive rate , and the false omission rate . 

 the original formula as give by matthews be : 

 n = \mathit{tn } + \mathit{tp } + \mathit{fn } + \mathit{fp } 


 s = \frac { \mathit{tp } + \mathit{fn } } { n } 


 p = \frac { \mathit{tp } + \mathit{fp } } { n } 


 \text{mcc } = \frac { \mathit{tp } / n - s \time p } { \sqrt { p s   ( 1 - s )   ( 1 - p ) } } 


 this be equal to the formula give above . as a correlation coefficient , the matthews correlation coefficient be the geometric mean of the regression coefficient of the problem and its dual . the component regression coefficient of the matthews correlation coefficient be markedness ( δp ) and youden 's j statistic ( informedness or δp ' ) . markedness and informedness correspond to different direction of information flow and generalize youden 's j statistic , the   \delta p statistic and ( as their geometric mean ) the matthews correlation coefficient to more than two class .

159,Uncertain data," in computer science , uncertain datum be datum that contain noise that make it deviate from the correct , intended or original value . in the age of big datum , uncertainty or datum veracity be one of the defining characteristic of datum . datum be constantly grow in volume , variety , velocity and uncertainty ( 1/veracity ) . uncertain data be find in abundance today on the web , in sensor network , within enterprise both in their structured and unstructured source . for example , there may be uncertainty regard the address of a customer in an enterprise dataset , or the temperature reading capture by a sensor due to age of the sensor . in 2012 ibm call out manage uncertain datum at scale in its global technology outlook report that present a comprehensive analysis look three to ten year into the future seek to identify significant , disruptive technology that will change the world . in order to make confident business decision base on real - world datum , analysis must necessarily account for many different kind of uncertainty present in very large amount of datum . analysis base on uncertain datum will have an effect on the quality of subsequent decision , so the degree and type of inaccuracy in this uncertain datum can not be ignore . 
 uncertain data be find in the area of sensor network ; text where noisy text be find in abundance on social medium , web and within enterprise where the structured and unstructured datum may be old , outdated , or plain incorrect ; in model where the mathematical model may only be an approximation of the actual process . when represent such datum in a database , some indication of the probability of the correctness of the various value also need to be estimate . 

 there be three main model of uncertain datum in database . in attribute uncertainty , each uncertain attribute in a tuple be subject to its own independent probability distribution . for example , if reading be take of temperature and wind speed , each would be describe by its own probability distribution , as know the reading for one measurement would not provide any information about the other . 

 in correlated uncertainty , multiple attribute may be describe by a joint probability distribution . for example , if reading be take of the position of an object , and the x- and y - coordinate store , the probability of different value may depend on the distance from the record coordinate . as distance depend on both coordinate , it may be appropriate to use a joint distribution for these coordinate , as they be not independent . 

 in tuple uncertainty , all the attribute of a tuple be subject to a joint probability distribution . this cover the case of correlated uncertainty , but also include the case where there be a probability of a tuple not belong in the relevant relation , which be indicate by all the probability not sum to one . for example , assume we have the follow tuple from a probabilistic database : 
  ( a , 0.4 ) | ( b , 0.5 ) 

 then , the tuple have 10 % chance of not exist in the database . ",data mining,Machine learning

 the law of large number say that , for each single event , its empirical frequency in a sequence of independent trial converge ( with high probability ) to its theoretical probability . but in some application , we be interested not in a single event but in a whole family of event . We would like to know whether the empirical frequency of every event in the family converge to its theoretical probability simultaneously . the uniform convergence theorem give a sufficient condition for this convergence to hold . roughly , if the event - family be sufficiently simple ( its vc dimension be sufficiently small ) then uniform convergence hold .
