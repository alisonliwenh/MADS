The Blogspot's one doesn't have the information of yellow bars, but shows the number of wins. It might be occurred because of the layout on different platforms/softwares. Moreover, it is definitely caused by human factors, like the authors or editors' carelessness.\n",

For the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, we provide some example code to get the data into the right structure. The points for each visualization are distributed: (30 points: 9 (1st problem) + 7 (each of 2nd, 3rd & 4th)).\n",

    "*IMPORTANT BROWSER ISSUE*: For some non-ES6 Browsers there are problems with date/time conversions (see [this](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/times_and_dates.html)). If things aren't working try something like Chrome for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT DATA ISSUE*: There are some differences in the data that 538 used and what we have. This will cause some issues to how things are normalized. Things should look very similar, but you may find, for example, that the scale of tweets when you normalize is different than the original figure. This is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

Five seconds later, Mayweather leapt up on the corner ropes, victorious — [50-0](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mayweather-is-defined-by-the-zero-next-to-his-name/). Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end. While the result may never have been in question, this was a welcome outcome for many who viewed Mayweather’s last megafight against Manny Pacquiao as an epic 😴😴😴😴."
